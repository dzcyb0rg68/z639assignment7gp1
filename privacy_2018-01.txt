1	 thereisnoprivacy	 As I mentioned [earlier](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7j1uc9/how_email_open_tracking_quietly_took_over_the_web/dr4ga3i/):&gt; Between all the metadata emails leak, the various tracking methods, and the fact that setting up email encryption is particularly onerous (when compared to other options), there's really an urgent need to move away from email communications to instant messaging. I try to send all sensitive files/do all communications over secure messaging options now. Email is a pain in the ass. 	
2	 halfiXD	 There never was a shred of doubt in my mind that people knew their software "privacy" is futile hence they don't manufacture their own hardware. But enjoy a read about the worlds most popular OS (and inb4, intel isn't the only one having such "features") https://www.networkworld.com/article/3236064/servers/minix-the-most-popular-os-in-the-world-thanks-to-intel.html	
3	 _Dangma_Dzyu_	 This is weird. The other day I had read a fairly long forum thread (somewhere), involving a cryptomator representative, and the rep was explaining how the encrypting is Open Source, but the client software itself is not open.(Maybe this was an old post and things have changed, since you are right it is on GitHub, and it does seem that CryptoMator is consistently referred to as Open Source in all DuckDuckGo results. Maybe something changed? Or maybe I was reading about CryptoDuck or something?)The Rep was saying that due to business concerns, the code wouldn't be released.Just found something: https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7ayaey/psa_mobile_cryptomator_is_not_open_source/Turns out the Mobile Apps are closed source? **Edit**: This is what I was reading before: https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android/issues/1I didn't realize it was just talking about the android app at the time (I hadn't looked closely at the link I guess). This is a concern for me though, because I would like to use Cryptomator on some Android Tablets.

8	 kyotogold	 You too, Presley Walker. If that's your real name. 	
9	 _Dangma_Dzyu_	 Assuming you're encrypting client side, and only storing encrypted files remotely, it shouldn't really matter. But VPS providers require ultimate trust, which is unwarranted. I don't have the means to maintain a private server with the desired uptime and bandwidth.	
10	 thereisnoprivacy	 Don't forget to also strip metadata from the photos (you can use [exiftool](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/zesty/man1/exiftool.1p.html) on ubuntu). 	
11	 xgwujrep	 Whenever possible.Not perfect, but it's pretty damn good. Despite this, most people don't care. In fact, there's now a growing fashion to just diss PGP.	
12	 Rafficer	 Just for kraken to be honest cause you can add your public key there. But way more companies should allow that!	
13	 thereisnoprivacy	 Yes, but as I said finding out the files weren't damaged won't protect you against rogue files, it'd just make sure the files you're getting are working rogue files. Verifying the crypotographic signature of the file also lets you know that the file wasn't damaged while downloading, while at the same time also allowing you to actually trust the file. There are instructions on how to verify signatures in the thread right above yours: https://reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7n1arx/checking_file_signaturesTL;DR: don't waste time verifying checksum hashes, verify signatures instead.	
14	 thereisnoprivacy	 If you want file encryption, use something like VeraCrypt or GPG.

17	 algebros	 Cool, thanks for digging that up. So it looks like the desktop app is fully open source, but the iOS and android apps are proprietary (most likely so they can charge for them). Is that your understanding as well?	
18	 xgwujrep	 Don't lie. Just say "No!".Don't borrow, use cash. Then start writing newspapers, Congressmen, and anyone else you think might hurt them. Make it expensive. Force them to pay lawyers. Count these onerous efforts as your good deed for the day. Fighting back doesn't make you weird or a crank. Most people will understand. You didn't wake up in a bad mood - someone actively forced you into it.*Everyone* knows corporations don't need your social security number and likely aren't legally allowed to ask for it. The reason they just squeezing people is because all of us are wusses. Corporations know their chance of pushing through is almost 100%.Not wiling to say no and hurt them? Hand over your lunch money. Just remember, your ancestors would have cracked skulls.

31	 triangulatedtundra	 I have a close group of friends which I'm trying to warm up to the idea of privacy and secure communication.  I've gotten most of us to use Signal, and I hope to eventually persuade them to set up and become familier with PGP.  I think it would be benificial to set up the framework for secure communication with people that matter to you in the event you may need it.

35	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; Is there anything that can be done to make it safer? I posted a brief list of basic PDF reader hardening steps [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/6qx3l6/how_to_securely_open_pdfs/dl10vq0/) a little while ago:&gt; PDFs are **very, very dangerous**. The attack surface of PDFs is massive; just about any nasty thing you can think of from tracking to malware, they can be made to do.&gt; &gt; First thing's first: the best method of avoiding being stung by malicious PDF payloads is to avoid dealing with PDFs whenever possible:&gt; &gt; * Always try to find a copy of the data in the PDF in any other format. Do a web search for the title of the document to see if it's available in another document format; if not, you can also try using Google's 'cache' link, which will display the PDF in plaintext.&gt; &gt; * If someone sends you a PDF document, write back saying you do not accept PDFs and to please send it to you in another format (PNG for image/layout-heavy content; TXT or HTML or ODF or RTF for text content). The more people that start outright refusing PDF files, and being extremely vocal about it, the less acceptable this cancer of a format will become.&gt; &gt; If opening a PDF is unavoidable, then the next steps are to lock down your environment:&gt; &gt; * Turn off all scripting in your PDF reader.&gt;&gt; * In your firewall, make sure you block all outbound/inbound internet access to your PDF reader.&gt; &gt; * Scan the PDF file with a local (not cloud-based) anti-malware program (e.g. ClamAV).&gt;  &gt; * Open the PDF either in a virtual machine, or on a separate device altogether (if you have an old laptop or phone with nothing significant on it and without internet access, then that's great). And to expand on this: To give you an idea of how vast the attack surface of PDFs is, [in one year just one guy found over 100 vulnerabilities](https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-17/materials/asia-17-Liu-Dig-Into-The-Attack-Surface-Of-PDF-And-Gain-100-CVEs-In-1-Year-wp.pdf). That's just one security researcher in one year. To reiterate: the best approach is to avoid PDFs if possible. If you cannot avoid them, the next best step is to convert them. If the PDF you are being sent is predominantly text-only (ask the sender, don't open it to find out!), then simply extract the raw text using pdftotext in poppler. If the PDF is predominantly images, then use pdfimages in poppler. If the PDF is a mix of text/image content, and extracting the text/images separately using the above tools would make it unreadable/a hassle to read, then use pdftoppm (once again, in the ever-helpful poppler library) to convert the PDF pages into PNG images.The one thing you don't want to do is use any of the multitude of online virus scanners or document converter websites: they can easily harvest the potentially-sensitive information in your document. Always perform your scans and conversions locally. 	
36	 australian_user	 I sign 100% of my emails with PGP and attach my public key. There’s a few friends I email that I use PGP with. 	
37	 thereisnoprivacy	 Because Apple is a corporation. Their objective is to make money. Today, the path of least resistance to making money is user exploitation. Don't trust Apple because they are not your friends, they don't give a shit about you any further than they can profit off of you(r data). 	
38	 thereisnoprivacy	 There is no whitelist. And the blacklist includes every corporation by virtue of it being a corporation. 	
39	 trai_dep	 At least monthly. Sometimes weekly. When I'm working with smarter clients, daily.The thing is, PGP has advantages over OTR. Sometimes adults have thoughts that are more complicated they need to express and chat windows and those dynamics just don't cut it. It has advantages over web-based solutions, too. I like owning my own data locally, not on someone's cloud, plus signed applications that reside on my hard drive. Java and JS based apps *should* be the same (pinky swear!), but who really knows? OTR/Chat is fine. ProtonMail &amp; Tutanota are great. But there's still room for GPG as well.	
40	 4and3and2andOne1	 Happy new year 	
41	 thereisnoprivacy	 I believe I pretty specifically spelled out why 'all the hate on VPNs' in the first post: they cannot be trusted. Their claims of no logging cannot be verified (even if there is evidence of them resisting requests for logs in some cases, there is nothing to say they wouldn't resist in other cases). There are also any number of exploits against various VPN setups. Tor is not only a cheaper, it's also a much safer alternative. 	
42	 thereisnoprivacy	 A flaming bag of poop is just silly. A more proportionate response would be to send the CEO a letter that's identical in tone to the letter the ISP sends, so that the CEO can get the same experience. So, something along the lines of:&gt; Please be advised that you devoting resources to writing intimidation letters to customers may affect your ability to devote resources to other services, such as your ability to check the breaks on your wife's car. I'm kidding, of course. Haha.

50	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; But what he has never shared on the social network, or anywhere else online, is a picture of himself.&gt; "I choose to share virtually everything about myself on social media, but my face is the essence of me individually and this is about refusing to give up the last piece of identifiable information that I can control."Remember the mythical time when news agencies had fact checkers?It took less than five minutes to find this guy's photo; on his own website, no less:http://www.horizonpr.com/documents/PDF-3D-Design.pdfWhich makes the whole 'human interest' angle of the article transparently untrue. So the question is why did the BBC uncritically accept this guy's claims, which are trivially disprovable in minutes? Why was some PR shill allowed to spew whatever crap he wanted in a BBC story with apparently no fact checking? What's going on here?I'm not a journalist, I'm not a fact checker, I'm just a random, ordinary person and was able to find out that this guy's claims of being super-duper-vigilant about never having his photo up online are BS in a matter of minutes (he has his photo up on his own firm's website, for Christ's sake!)--why was the BBC unwilling/unable to do this and just believed his yarn?

69	 sting_12345	 Why do you say that?  The apps are sandboxed and it's not like android isn't open source or anything.  Signal with android is as secure as it gets, even from the DEA's and FBI's of the world.  Apple has shown that they WILL defend you over the feds, they've done it now countless times.  Why would you say that when all evidence points to the contrary?  Signal over iOS or android is what the CIA suggested the HRC campaign to use after they consulted with coutnerstrike and the FBI.  After they were mercilessly hacked by the Russians and whoever else wanted the info.  Signal is safe with or without GCM.  Neither gives you anonymity but will definitely give you security.  The two are different animals altogether. 	
70	 playaspec	 From a privacy standpoint, no carrier has an advantage. 	
71	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; What makes chat apps more secure than email?Obviously this will vary for different secure chat apps, but broadly speaking what secure chat offers which email lacks is the following (and yes, I'm sweeping related issues revolving around anonymity and privacy with security in here):* Decreased metadata leaks. For instance, there is no plaintext subject line announcing the contents of the chat message. This could be done with email as well if you leave the subject line blank of course, but most people don't; instead most people conveniently explain exactly what is in the email message even if the message is itself encrypted.* Forward secrecy. If ever your private key(s) are compromised, it won't be possible to read old chat messages, but it will be possible to read all old email messages encrypted with those keys. This could be done with email if you generate new keypairs for each email exchange, but that is ridiculously cumbersome and not something people do.* Deniability. Because secure chat apps use shared secrets, an adversary cannot prove that you sent a given message (because the recipient could have also produced it, hence a shared secret). This cannot be done with email because with GPG only the sender can sign the email message, there's no denying it. * Minimized Tracking Attack Surface. There are less ways to compromise chat participants than email participants. Sure, you can still send rogue files and rogue links/images, but you generally can't send rogue HTML or leverage URL prefetching, as most chat apps don't support HTML messages or prefetching, unlike web browsers and mail clients. * Implementation. It's generally a lot easier to launch a secure messaging app (or even add secure plug-ins to one) than it is to setup email encryption. Which means less room to mess something up by not ticking the right box somewhere. 	
72	 Fahad78	 &gt;DNSCrypt is a protocol that authenticates communications between a DNS client and a DNS resolver. It prevents DNS spoofing. It uses cryptographic signatures to verify that responses originate from the chosen DNS resolver and haven't been tampered with.&gt;It is an open specification, with free and open source reference implementations, and it is not affiliated with any company nor organization.Use it all the time, also use openNIC.	
73	 eixxssxd	 It's hard to change minds until they feel it personally. By then. it's often too late. They've already hanged themselves. Mistakes which are hard to undo. Like talking a steer out of entering that killing chute?Have you ever tried to talk people out of taking on student loans? Or borrowing money? Same deal.Find new friends. I'm very serious.

No change.If enough prospects demanded a 3% discount for cash - they'd get it.Different incident, different purchase.

89	 TzeentchianKitten	 Eh, I don't find remembering a system to be that inconvenient. And even if I did, security is worth a mild inconvenience. "Convenience" is not the be-all, end-all, of internet use; and thinking that it is is the easiest way to get yourself in trouble. Some things *should* be a pain in the ass to do, because it reminds you how important that it is.    Edit: For example, I don't ever want it to be "easy" to log into my online banking. To me, the harder it is the better. For the same reason I will continue to refuse the offer of contactless cards from my bank. Spending money should be difficult, so should logging in to my primary email account.	
90	 JackSkell0255	 I'm not really a joiner(!), but places like Amazon, and maybe bank or utility sites ask for that information. Another for-instance, I don't consider utility companies to need to know anything about me (or anything THAT in-depth) because the nature of the association is so casual:  they wire electricity to me, I pay them. If I don't, they shut it off. Not hard. They don't need my ssn or my mothers maiden name for that. Same, perhaps, with any DSL/cable internet provider. If I somehow need to order service in another place, they may not get all the correct information they think they need, particularly in view of their internet traffic tracking. Why should they get my real information associated with my internet traffic?

100	 potatoclip	 Very well.[Lavabit court order](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/801182-redacted-pleadings-exhibits-1-23.html) where SSL (nowadays TLS) keys are demanded. See Attatchment B on page 36.[Interview where Lavabit founder Ladar Levison admits using RSA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?=XTe0mT1611c&amp;v=7LzKjxj0u_s#t=32m37s). Now, while using RSA is not being said directly there is only non-forward secret RSA, and forward secret Diffie-Hellman (see [RFC 5246's Key Exchange](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.7) for proof on this). So when Levison says he did not use Diffie-Hellman, he must have been using RSA.To quote on [RFC 5246's 7.4.7.1.  RSA-Encrypted Premaster Secret Message](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.7.1)      If RSA is being used for key agreement and authentication, the      client generates a 48-byte premaster secret, encrypts it using the      public key from the server's certificate, and sends the result in      an encrypted premaster secret message.  This structure is a      variant of the ClientKeyExchange message and is not a message in      itself.If you read [RFC 5246's chapters 8.1 and 8.1.1 on Master Secret computing (for RSA)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-8.1), you'll find that the premaster secret is combined with ClientRandom and ServerRandom to derive the symmetric keys used to encrypt the session. Therefore, having access to server-side RSA private key can retrospectively decrypt any passively collected session with following associated packets:* ClientHello (containing ClientRandom)* ServerHello (containing ServerRandom)* RSA-key encrypted premaster secret(the three that form the symmetric key for session) and* Session packets encrypted with the symmetric key◻	
101	 sting_12345	 Dashlane is fine and good, so is 1password standalone version.  That is what I use not the cloud based version.  You have a vault that is 256 AES encrypted but it's not housed on 1password servers.  Just your machine or your phone or cloud backup etc.....  The vault backups are also encrypted when you make one.  I have one made every day and it auto uploads into an encrypted tresor.  So that 2x encrypted for my backups.  So then I can reach them via a tablet or phone in my encrypted cloud storage.  Dashlane is the same I think if you don't want to pay you can use the vault that lives only on your machine or machines.  Exporting and backup aren't as easy peasy as their cloud but it's much more secure.  They could get hacked to hell and it wouldn't affect me since they are standalone programs and nothing is sent to them.

115	 BurgerUSA	 You can use BitWarden to host your passwords on your own server using whatever encryption service you prefer or clone their whole software on github. 	
116	 potatoclip	 Telegram has opt-in end-to-end encryption. I would highly recommend understanding the implications of it's [received audit](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1177.pdf):&gt;**Abstract**: Telegram is a popular messaging app which supports end-to-end encrypted communication. In Spring 2015 we performed an audit of Telegram's source code. This short paper summarizes our findings.&gt;Our main discovery is that the symmetric encryption scheme used in Telegram -- known as MTProto -- is **not IND-CCA secure**, since **it is possible to turn any ciphertext into a different ciphertext that decrypts to the same message**.&gt;We stress that **this is a theoretical attack on the definition of security and we do not see any way of turning the attack into a full plaintext-recovery attack**. At the same time, **we see no reason why one should use a less secure encryption scheme when more secure (and at least as efficient) solutions exist.**&gt;The take-home message (once again) is that well-studied, provably secure encryption schemes that achieve strong definitions of security (e.g., authenticated-encryption) **are to be preferred** to home-brewed encryption schemes.So the end-to-end encryption while not semantically secure, is not broken. However, following limitations have to be acknowledged:1. End-to-end encryption is opt-in, therefore non-tech savvy users (I can only imagine it's the majority of the 180 million monthly users) do not make use of it. These people enjoy the equivalent privacy on their metadata and content as users of Facebook do: The server has access to everything. [Durov's defense](http://telegra.ph/Why-Isnt-Telegram-End-to-End-Encrypted-by-Default-08-14) does not hold water when dissected:    Despite what he says, it is possible to build backups with client-side encryption. Just because some apps have bad approaches, doesn't mean there can't be good ones. Labeling Signal a niche app is not a way to have a rational debate about security practices. After dissecting problems, Durov tells that Telegram uses insecure chats with big-time features by default, but that it also features chats with the security features users should have, but that don't have the conveniences users deserve. This is because Telegram developers do have the know-how regarding how to implement the features securely.    &gt;"we rely on our own distributed cross-jurisdictional encrypted cloud storage"     This is an epuhenism for "we have a network of computer systems that can deliver content from any user to any other user". This means that a US citizen traveling to Europe can connect to Telegram's Dutch server, and talk to their friends at home that connect to US server. It also means anyone with access to that persons phone can access that same data. It also means anyone who hacks the server can make those same requests to the server, but pretend to be any user, or all of them. If you think Telegram can build a server NSA's [TAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailored_Access_Operations) can not hack any of the servers, by all means, use Telegram's "encrypted cloud". But consider this: If Telegram's servers were invulnerable, what's the point of providing end-to-end encryption? Also, while Durov implies they would never access your history, his earlier creation VKontakte was all about mining user data, just like Facebook, the founder of which called their users "[Dumb fucks](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/09/20/the-face-of-facebook)".   &gt; "Unlike WhatsApp, we can allow our users to access their Telegram message history from several devices at once thanks to our built-in instant cloud sync."     This is not an argument for anything else than speed. End-to-end encryption does not block use of multiple clients: WhatsApp and Signal are living breathing proof of this. It is slower, but you don't buy a car based on seller telling it goes 400mph by default. Sure, it's fast, but being able to offer that required stripping the security you need.    &gt; "Unlike on WhatsApp, on Telegram you don’t have to store your entire message history on your phone all the time"     This is not a valid argument in this day and age. Your phone has enough space to store all messages you will ever exchange. What Durov essentially says, "I can keep a backup of it for you", you should say, I can do that my self, and then move the media files to your SpiderOak cloud, OwnCloud or private server over SFTP.    &gt; "Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is able to provide persistent group chats with up to 10,000 members or channels with no limit on max size. These technologies can not be implemented within the “e2ee+third-party backups” paradigm."     There is in fact nothing that prevents scaling end-to-end encryption to 10 000 users. Signal and WhatsApp either encrypt the group message using symmetric key of each contact, or if you share media, that media will be encrypted with a key and it will be shared via server. The decryption key for each contact will follow, when your phone sends copies of it, encrypted with each contact's key. It is slower, but again, the alternative is to have the equivalent security of Facebook.    I'm bringing this article up because I want to point out the fact Telegram developers would rather defend their insecure model than admit mistakes and go through the painstaking work of reimplementing everything the secure way. They don't consider the privacy of you or the 180 million users worth the effort.2. End-to-end encryption has inter-client incompatibility. Some Telegram clients do not support end-to-end encryption at all.3. There is no end-to-end encryption available for group communication even on platforms that offer one-on-one end-to-end encryption.Jakobsen &amp; Orlandi are right: apps with better design should be preferred, and since Signal offers end-to-end encryption without exception, it definitely outshines Telegram.

126	 attrigh	 &gt; is completely paranoid and non-sense from a business perspective.Agreed. I think them being hacked is more of a problem~&gt; a good paid password manager uses strong encryption and 2FA.I wouldn't be surprised if the aren't "zero knowledge" though... I would be happy to be corrected. If they get completely owned then they probably lose all their passwords.	
127	 theantnest	 I recently went down this road, and also asked questions in this sub.Long story short I went with [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) after a few people here recommended it.It's free, it's open source and your data is in the cloud with AES256 encryption, which to this date has never been broken. If you really want to go the whole hog, you can setup your own cloud on your own server, but personally I'm not confident in my skills of server hardening, so I'd rather leave it to the experts.I use a ridiculously long and complex but memorable and (kinda) easy to type master password.So far, after a month or so of use, it's been great. Works with Firefox, Edge, Chrome, TOR, Android, iOS, and has a decent web frontend as well.	
128	 australian_user	 I use it 100% of the time. 	
129	 sting_12345	 He doesn't use his phone for Twitter lol. He uses an aide or a special one just for Twitter. Obama had the same restrictions on his phones. 	
130	 BowserJewnior	 Yet another reason to not use Internet of Shit devices	
131	 tiiaj	 Regarding jurisdiction, the important information is actually *The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. Thanks to that, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force Telegram to give up any data.*	
132	 sting_12345	 No wickr me.... The free version has a complete audit from two different respective companies. Wickr for teams has not and is not open for review. Wickr just had this done recently so stop with all the FUD.  Threema also has been audited completely by outside sources. Have you even read the entire white papers from both companies?  John abbot in Australia used wickr to basically stage a coup lol and nobody knew until it was all over. Now as part of the five eyes nation's id be inclined to think if wickr was compromised he wouldn't have used it. He'll even WhatsApp is foiling the gchq and us the go to app for Islamic extremists. Amber rudd said so herself lol. If they can't Crack WhatsApp then I'm pretty sure the others are fine.Oh and as for Apple the fbi could not open the phone and it was a junky 5c with no secure enclave and was 32 bit. Now all ios devices are 64 bit and celebrite said themselves they cannot bypass the 64 bit ios devices. The fbi can't even crack the Vegas shooters iPhone se. Unless you are an active insurgent ios is super secure. He'll even android us if you know what to do. 	
133	 8lbIceBag	 I feel like you know me bra, anything I say here is a lost cause. Should have explained my reasoning and all that I suppose, but I'm on my phone, without a proper keyboard, and I just don't have the time to elaborate a well defined post. So that's just my "tl;Dr".Anyways, unless yall think this post is another piece of Shit that doesn't add to the conversation which warrents more downvotes (you fuckers that hate dissenting opinions) , continue0 the convo fun here and in 3 days I'll have a proper computer in front of me where I can articulate a lil better.If  I get a decent amount of upvotes that shows people even give a shit, I'll give a good response. Otherwise I'm busy ruining reddit and not adding to the conversation, that's what the downvote means need I remind you. And I'm at negative 88,and you can only go to negative 99. So my comment must really suck. But fuck yall, yall need to think (and I know my comment isn't a good reflection that, but it's rooted in the idea that y'all don't think for yourselves ) Edit : anyway, look up Germany. Basically defined fascist. Their whole political system was in left ideas Slovene sense had a good reply to my comment above, and maybe they deleted it because I remember reading it, but it was something about full circle. How either extreme was like the other. But the term he used, was accurate and good and I feel like wound have satisfied y'all as a middle ground, can't remember what it was though. Guess he's better at identifying a sinking ship of a post 	
134	 lestofante	 Opensource does NOT mean free. Selling password is deleterious, giving them to a government is mandatory and mass spy happened in the past, even if with different company. Even if you think you have nothing to hide, some NSA agent had been found spying on ex and love rivals.Plus just because we are on this subreddit we are already on some sort of list.	
135	 tiiaj	 FWIW, a quote from Durov: *Key management is also the area where iMessage fails to deliver on their end-to-end encryption promise. Apple controls the central server that is used to distribute public keys and connect new devices, which may be convenient but is also very vulnerable. Apple doesn’t have your private keys, but they can “connect” another “device” to your account so they can read your messages without your knowledge and send copies of messages that were meant for you to anyone who has the power to make them do this (e.g., a US government agency).* Signal doesn't have that issue.	
136	 lestofante	 If they get hacked and have autoupdate, they can collect all data, unless you use some sort of firewall to prevent the app from internet access

140	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 But password managers give you security *and* convenience. You should be rotating passwords regularly anyway regardless of your system, and a password manager helps by:* having one really important password, so it's convenient to rotate it* making it really easy to rotate a password for a given site* has a list of all sites that have passwords you need to rotateI try to rotate my passwords yearly, though my goal is to continually increase that frequency so if there's a big leak, it's likely that I've already rotated that password before it gets exploited.Sometimes you can have security *and* convenience, and a password manager gives you just that. Just remember to rotate your master password regularly (my goal this year is monthly).

143	 potatoclip	 Having keys in multiple different places than server data only works if encrypted disk is not mounted. If server has access to data on disk, it must by definition have the entire decryption key in it's main memory. The disk might be physically in another country, but I'm quite sure no country would consider something like remote LUKS a legal barrier. If the data is accessible in the country that makes the request, it most likely must be provided. IANAL, however. But rather than ask us to take these claims at face value, Telegram should quote the exact laws that provide the protection for their setup, as well as any set precedent, and provide technical documents about how their cloud is set up.But that's the legal side. No matter how robust the legal setup is, NSA can hack the Dutch server without a warrant. In such situations, the only rule they have to abide by is, "don't get caught".

149	 sting_12345	 1password does not have auto update on the standalone program. There is no syncing ever unless you initiate your own backup. Same with dash lane once you say no to the paid version. They just become local vaults you can live around on your own or not.Is that what you mean or do you mean if the device or computer gets hacked? In that case the vault auto locks on your setting so they would get an encrypted vault is all. Useless.

152	 nolbraun	 This. I mean I've uploaded my public key so my friends could encrypt emails to me but nobody I know (who I might actually email occasionally) has uploaded theirs so it's clearly not a concern for them...	
153	 GoJaonPa	 Yeah, even my friends that studied IT too don’t use encryption...	
154	 nolbraun	 Kinda reminds me of that CIA leak that said Comodo av was such a pain in the ass. My immediate thinking was: Comodo is probably cake for them to exploit so they deliberately want people to think that it foils them so more will migrate to Comodo. Conversely, F-Secure probably gives them a hard time so they propagate the idea that it's a "lower-tier product that causes us minimal difficulty.”

156	 iliadeverest	 &gt; I currently run Win10 but if I were to run Linux on a separate drive partition could windows still look into those files?Yes, theoretically.  In practice, Windows does not have a file system driver for Linux file systems. But then again, Windows could just read the raw data from the hard disk.&gt; What if Linux was launched on a vm, would the use of a vm prevent windows from being able to read what is done in that os?Of course not. Windows owns that virtual machine.&gt; Also, if my goal is to only occasionally be private would it then be better to run tails from a usbYes. Though "only occasionally be private" is not a very great goal.&gt; , possibly through Linux in one of the above configurations?This makes no sense.Honestly though, try a better separation. Have one computer that runs exclusively GNU/Linux for peace of mind. You can get a second-hand/refurbished Thinkpad for cheap anywhere, which will run GNU/Linux amazingly well and last you for years.Read up on [Free Software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) (also sometimes called Open Source Software) while you're at it.

158	 Mr2001	 &gt;Must have either been Facebook knowing that the friend was in our house, or Facebook was eavesdropping.Is your wife friends with that person on Facebook too? This sounds like they're just targeting their users' friends.	
159	 Mr2001	 &gt;When I analyzed the raw data from WireShark, the majority of outgoing traffic to Facebook uses the Facebook Zero (FB_ZERO) protocol. This protocol is primarily used to send/receive data between you and Facebook without counting against a data plan limit, but also has the advantage of getting a 0-round-trip encryption handshake, speeding up the encrypted content delivery.Are you sure you aren't being charged for that data? Might want to double check your bill... I think you're conflating two different things (with similar names) that were developed years apart.**Zero round trip** security handshake: "When looking at data about a year ago [2016], we found that the time taken by the 1-RTT optimized security handshake during connection establishment was quite high ... We decided to experiment with zero round-trip (0-RTT) security protocols ... Over the past year [2017], we've built and deployed Zero protocol to our mobile apps and load balancers."**Zero rating**: "Facebook Zero is an initiative [...] whereby [mobile] providers waive data (bandwidth) charges [...] for accessing Facebook on phones via a stripped-down text-only version of its mobile website ... launched on May 18, 2010"Note, "mobile website" -- accessed through a browser, with regular HTTPS. (More technical detail [here](https://www.facebook.com/notes/digicel/all-the-information-you-need-on-facebook-0facebookcom/10150419514896024/).)	
160	 bishbla	 Well, yes, that's why I made it a proviso in my last post.	
161	 lestofante	 I'm not talking about autoupdate of the vault, but of the program itself. Imagine an hacker that steal the password for the developer account on the store/website and release its own version..If they get hacked, is much less problematic than  clear-cloud version, but still dangerous	
162	 lestofante	 Depends, many service are based in country they have no power on; your wallet may contains which website they are from, telling them services that maybe you use from VPN or tor; and finally you have private key used for sign/encrypt (as example for e-mail)

167	 Geminii27	 The industry is competitive for *profit*. You'd have to convince them that the profit they made from spying on people, using that data to tweak services on the fly for more profit, and selling the data to other businesses, was less than the profit they could make from *not* doing that. Particularly when the majority of consumers can't even tell when they're being spied on and often don't care.

CALEA is a reason to move research and development out from the US. CALEA-free devices will probably be available in the gray market.Broadly, the EFF seems to be in line with privacy.	
181	 TzeentchianKitten	 I rotate my passwords for anything important/valuable like primary email accounts and my Steam account, and anything like that also has 2FA and runs on a different system to my "main" password system anyway. It seems like that level of security is a bit unnecessary for everything else though, like random website logins and whatever.    I dunno though, you may be convincing me, but there is still something I really don't like about it, though I realise that's generally not a good reason for doing/not doing something. I guess I'll think about it some more when I am not hungover, and maybe experiment with some different ones to see how they work.

192	 xfcgvt	 Keepass is inately more secure than any cloud based manager because it doesn't require use of the cloud and you retain full control over your database so if you do want to put it in the cloud you can encrypt it yourself (and host it yourself if you're really paranoid but solid encryption will almost entirely negate the potential risk of using a maybe-not-trustworthy cloud storage service) rather than taking some companys word that they'll do it right.Cloud based managers aside from requiring you to give up full control of your passwords to some company somewhere add another point of failure because they keep such a wealth of data that they're very desireable targets for hacking.Keepass really isn't that hard to use. Give it a try, you have nothing to lose, and if it's not for you use Bitwarden or something (NOT Lastpass their security is horrible). Just make sure you use 2FA.

196	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 If Malwarebytes can't pick a malware, or if a factory reset isn't solving the issue, either you have a hardware issue, or the malware has linked up with your media files which you transfer back to your phone after the factory reset. If you can't diagnose the issue, take it to the store or flash a custom ROM.	
197	 gecko_velours	 If you use Windows (8.1, RT or 10), I can recommend ModernKeePass, which is compatible with KeePass databases, open source and quite user friendly in my opinion!	
198	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 Switch to Firefox. Safari is not as good for privacy. Using DDG or Startpage is a good move. Running VPN's is a good idea. But that's the problem with Apple devices. You can be safe on an online level. You can't change the system apps like you can on Android. For example, Android users can use NewPipe instead of the official YouTube app, Flash a custom ROM, etc. Sell the iPhone and get an Android if you want granular privacy control.

Ah, the joys of big data.

The attacker has been compromising the reddit accounts of tip recipients and withdrawing their tip balance. This attacker definitely made off with (at least) thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoin.It really was a low hanging fruit for a hacker to try to compromise reddit. Still unkown how it is being done, and still no answer from anybody at Reddit.It's quite clear that the vulnerability is within Reddit and not the tippr bot.Most likely failure point is that somebody has access to the Reddit mail server and is grabbing password reset tokens from the outbox.

215	 cryptoguy255	 Use a different email for every exchange.If one exchange is hacked and your email is compromised they have enough information for social engineering and getting access to your account by opening a ticket to customer support with all that data.Enable 2fa on all your accounts including email.Don't use sms based 2fa only use TOTP 2fa.Use a offline device for your TOTP codes an old smartphone always in airplain mode is fine.TOTP is time based so you have to correct the clock manually if it is out of sync.Don't store coins that you don't trade on an exchange.Use a hardware wallets or cold storage for this.  And don't use a rooted phone.

225	 skidmark-steve	 Given that OSX is based on BSD, I wonder if this affects other BSD systems as well?	
226	 46u1rr3	 Looks like they're exploiting a very old problem. https://www.linux.com/news/password-vulnerability-firefox-2005The only web browser that correctly implemented a password manager was Opera with its "magic wand". It did not automatically fill out the login forms, instead requesting user authorization. Later a Firefox extension appeared that copied this functionality: Secure Login.https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/secure-login/	
227	 skidmark-steve	 If you liked that, you might also like the "Snowden" movie. It is less of a documentary and more of a drama, but it does still cover many of the facts and the guy who played Snowden did a good and convincing job at it.Snowden came out later too, so I think there are some more up-to-date tidbits in it which naturally did not make it into Citizenfour (because they hadn't discovered them yet).

231	 skidmark-steve	 I use Linux as the host and I run Windows 8.1 in a VGA pass-through setup without an Internet connection. That means high performance 3D gaming without spying. Unfortunately this setup is not exactly friendly to new users of Linux, and based on what hardware you are using, it might not even be supported.An easier thing to do would be to encrypt the Linux partition. That will stop Windows from reading through it even if Windows does contain secret undocumented functionality to do so. Only the /boot partition needs to be clear-text, and there are ways to verify that it has not been tampered with when the system boots.	
232	 maxline388	 iOS is made by a company who does shady shit.The most recent thing is the battery bullshit.Also, flashing a new rom does not break your privacy. You can relock your bootloader.You don't know what your os is doing since it's closed source.	
233	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 I respectfully disagree with a lot that you have to say. You have talked about how Apple has demonstrated opposition to third party access. You have talked about Safari's capabilities. You have talked about how apps are sandboxed. While these things are true. The software backing all this, is not open source. It's closed source, thus we don't know the magnitude of how much information Apple is collecting. It's rather convenient to be hostile to third party developers, so they get to keep all the information about you with them. Also, do note what I said about Android. It gives you a lot more granular control. For the average person concerned about privacy. They can easily download apps from F-Droid. An entire competent app store dedicated to Free and Open Source Software. Yes, information is still passed onto Google. But it's far less than what goes to Apple. Since everything is made by Apple. And for those willing to go the extra mile for privacy on Android. There's an entire modding and rooting community. There are many alternatives ROM's to the default one running on the device. Open Source Alternatives like Lineage OS. These steps will completely cut you off from Google.*Apple has created a myth. They are not privacy centric.*	
234	 privacychair	 I recommend password safe https://pwsafe.org/It is open-source, simple and stand-alone and has many free packages for windows, android, linux.The reason I like it most is because the same encrypted file can be moved into the cloud and onto another device easily.There is no registration required, and it works great for teams, you can create a new password file anytime you need to share creds with teammates.  They can either use your same file, or merge it into their own master file.

239	 EffortlessRarity	 The most recent versions of 1Password and Dashlane make it really complicated to avoid using their web versions. Everybody now is following LastPass' model. If you've been using stand-alone versions of 1Password or Dashlane for a while you may be able to figure out how to keep your stuff out of their cloud servers. But if you recommend 1Password or Dashlane to a new user, don't expect them to be able to figure out how to use the product as a stand-alone.

244	 KRZ_759	 It really can get difficult without either a USB drive or a CD. The first idea is to write the Ubuntu installer to the hard drive you plan on installing it on. You would then use the BIOS to boot from that drive, and use the installer to install Ubuntu on that drive. I've successfully done this with Clonezilla but not with a full Linux distro. The second idea involves a Android phone with root capabilities. Using the app "USB Mountr", you can put the Ubuntu ISO in the phone's storage and the phone will act as a USB drive for the PC to boot from. I have successfully installed Linux in this way.Of course, flash drives and CDs are cheap and plentiful, so they'd still be a better choice.

256	 [deleted]	 The honest answer is, we don't. Hiding the user from search engine is the answer however. They can't track the searches if they don't know who is making them. That's why I use tor for 95% of my web browsing, i.e. for almost all but banking for example.

263	 JeffersonsSpirit	 To each his own, but I agree with you- I too use Tor for much of my browsing.My strategy is a little different than yours. I use Tor for this account, for researching of all kinds (history of tyranny, economic corruption, failing educational systems, geopolitics, reading sites with negative views of US government/policy, etc etc etc). I use Whonix for all this- if they want to track what I research, they better be prepared to drop serious $$ on a 0-day to expose me.I also have Firefox setup to do common things- things I wouldn't mind everyone knowing that I do. The Tor setup above allows me to feel free in what I look at, and to feel free to speak my mind; the Firefox browsing is for non-contentious research where my words or research are not a threat in any way to powered entities. Examples: checking the weather, reading stuff on world history (official narratives), researching math/physics/science/language, looking up words, reading wikipedia about various events, banking, etc.I basically compartmentalize my browsing between these two approaches, and for me this works to control tracking *in areas where I don't want to be tracked.* I use searx.me on Torbrowser. On Firefox I use Startpage or DuckDuckGo again because I dont really care here. To each his own again though. That you are mindful of this danger OP is good as it can help you develop a strategy to avoid being exploited by such entities.	
264	 JeffersonsSpirit	 What a fucking wild move by Snowden. Regardless of whether you agree with his actions (most of us here do of course), you cannot deny the dude has some serious balls.I just remember thinking while watching it "damn what a life... talk about entering the big time in a very bold way." Truly sad that a man had to endure so much stress and pay such a huge price to expose such tyranny, and its even worse that it seems everyone has forgotten. I owe Snowden my thanks as what he leaked drastically altered my use of technology and made me become aware of what was happening.The movie is worth the watch in case anyone is wondering...

266	 NoNameHDMoe	 Agreed, but I trust DDG rather than google/yahoo. I'm using a VPN 95% of the so it's not too bad	
267	 274Below	 OSX has a bug. If you can run a program on the computer, then you can exploit this bug to bypass the normal protections that the operating system offers, and gain complete control of the computer. This means you could install malware, reset passwords without user consent, or just erase everything. The sky is the limit.	
268	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Windows *could* have some super-secret ability to read all Linux filesystems, and the code to scan through your files and send some off to the mothership- the code is closed so who knows? Is it likely? I seriously doubt it, but I personally wouldn't take a chance when encryption is so easy. Encryption *solves* this problem- Windows can't do anything without the encryption password even in the above dystopian hypothetical.You would also want to ensure that you don't ever use the encryption password for anything on Windows (else theoretically it could use known passwords to try for access). Of course, Windows *could* alter your /boot partition to dump your encryption password to a hidden file and then use that, but this is definitely in paranoid territory. You could use grub and have /boot encrypted too- that would solve that potential compromise vector. Then perhaps Windows compromises the grub bootloader to get your key... You could solve this by having your Linux kernels and grub on a thumbdrive and point your UEFI to boot from there- that would solve almost every compromise possible short of Windows infecting your UEFI with malware code to gain Linux encryption keys to then surreptitiously get access to your data..The reality is, you can never know for *certain* you are safe from being had when you have non-free code on your computer. You can also go totally paranoid turning your computer into a fortress... that is painful to use because of all your various walls.The ultimate answer is that it depends on your threat model. IMO, anyone with a serious threat model isn't going to use WIndows anyways, so I think your case doesn't warrant the extreme examples I've listed above. I think simply encrypting your Linux partition will be good enough. I could see a current or future dystopia where they might take a peak at unencrypted partitions, but entering into actively attacking a user's computer is potentially catastrophic for Microsoft's image, and thus ultimately their profits. Its not worth the risk of destroying their business for the small benefit of gaining user data for 3% of the computer population.Encrypt with AES 256 bit encryption (xts plain 64 512 bit), and you'll be good. With modern processors having AES NI instructions you basically won't notice a performance penalty, and it will protect you from a sneaky Microsoft or what is much much MUCH more likely- a thief, adversarial roommate, etc.

270	 potatoclip	 To gain privacy in searching you have to understand the nature of your communication with the server.1. Receiving search results isn't something you need to register/login for, therefore you shouldn't use any service that has optional login page, or of you do, at least don't login.2. There is no expectation of privacy regarding the search field you fill. If you feed information to the search bar, DDG will have access to that information, so think before you type. Also, the more searches you make under specific visit to the page, the more likely that information can implicate it was you. So make sure it's one search per session.3. There is no expectation of privacy regarding the IP you leave to DDG, so they can tie searches if they want. The true nature of search engine is revealed when you use [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/). For example, Google refuses to provide service to customers it can not deanonymize, because that's not their business model. But DDG allows you to use Tor browser. That means they allow connections from the most anonymous system currently available. Do not take that as a clue about DDG not logging everything even if you don't use Tor. Always use Tor and force them to do the right thing. A good way to ensure you never connect without Tor is to use the [Tor Hidden Service site](http://3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion) ([Source it's the official one](https://duck.co/forum/thread/1762/is-the-duckduckgo-hidden-service-legitimate)) -- that only works with Tor Browser and is more secure and anonymous -- as the default search engine / home page / new tab page.4. Source code: This matters when you download something to your computer to be run. Source code must be compiled into a binary, and in that practice it's almost necessary to be able to do reproducible build to verify what you're running. But web pages are different. There is absolutely no way of confirming that [Source code available on GitHub](https://github.com/duckduckgo) is the exact same version as the one that was used to compile the binary that's running on server. The correct reason of opening the source code of server is to make the server runnable by anyone. The incorrect reason is to be able to prove what server is doing. The **correct** way to verify that the server is doing what it should, is to have **the open source client force the server do the right thing**. For example, it doesn't matter if Signal server spies on users' content and metadata: We can verify our clients end-to-end encrypt all content so server can't access it. We can't verify our metadata isn't accessed however, therefore we must not use Signal for purposes that require hiding metadata. With these two in mind, we don't have to care whether Signal server is open source (note: it is). The same way, Tor Browser forces DDG to serve you, while ensuring server doesn't receive any additional information.	
271	 Longent	 Thank you so much for this! This is just great. &gt; Turn off all scripting in your PDF readerWhat exactly does this mean and how do I do this? &gt; The attack surface of PDFs is massive; just about any nasty thing you can think of from tracking to malware, they can be made to do.Is the attack surface as large when accessing PDFs on an iPad? I have the Foxit reader app on my iPad at the moment but I'm not sure how secure it is. I can (and have) blocked outbound connections from the PDF reader I use on my PC, but I'm not sure what the iOS equivalent to doing this is. Opening PDFs on a separate machine isn't something I think I'd be willing to do, but opening PDFs in a virtual machine does sound feasible. Which one would you personally recommend?&gt; Scan the PDF file with a local (not cloud-based) anti-malware program (e.g. ClamAV)Would you say Malwarebytes is a suitable tool for locally scanning PDFs before opening them? I'm not against downloading more software, I'm just curious. Happy new year!

299	 uoxuho	 You should definitely check out Qubes OS. It creates multiple different virtual machines for different "domains" (work, personal, anonymous, for example, plus whatever else, or make your own custom set).As for a browser, I would argue that on Linux, plain old Firefox should be preferred over Waterfox or Seamonkey, though personally I'm considering nowadays ditching Firefox and perhaps adopting Qutebrowser.In any case, by using Qubes you wouldn't have to sacrifice your favourite features of one browser by using a bunch of different browsers; instead, you could just have for example a "games" Firefox and a "make-up" Firefox and a "music" Firefox. You can easily configure the network settings of each domain so that it uses its own VPN, Tor (via tightly integrating Whonix, which is great), or whatever else.The compartmentalizing that you're describing is a non-traditional desktop setup and is somewhat intense honestly, but if you're up for it then Qubes is definitely the most elegant, powerful, and secure way to get it done. I wish you luck and I'm sure all of us here on /r/privacy would love to read a write-up on your thoughts based on whatever it is that you end up using, whether you adopt Qubes or some other paradigm.

Again operator unwariness....failure to employ full disk encryption or PGP for all messages.Having old emails in secure storage which you can really search is a significant edge. Haven't seen any messenger which can do this efficiently. Keeping a local, private, encrypted imap email server online is a very efficient file cabinet. Nothing like it anywhere. .eml files are efficient records in the right hands.

326	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; The only security measure is that the album link is hard to guess.Yawn. Yes, that's the point. Not unlike the only security measure for your account is that your password is hard to guess (excluding 2FA).See: https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/23/8830977/google-photos-security-public-url-privacy-protected&gt; So why is that public URL more secure than it looks? The short answer is that the URL is working as a password. Photos URLs are typically around 40 characters long, so if you wanted to scan all the possible combinations, you'd have to work through 10^70 different combinations to get the right one, a problem on an astronomical scale. "There are enough combinations that it's considered unguessable," says Aravind Krishnaswamy, an engineering lead on Google Photos. "It's much harder to guess than your password." Because web traffic for Photos is encrypted with SSL, it's also kept secret from anyone on the network who might be listening in.&gt; More importantly, the photo isn't placed at that URL until you ask for it. Google Photos normally pulls its images through a more complex back-end system, but when a user right-clicks on one of their own images, Photos responds by placing the image at the designated public URL. Essentially, Google has reverse-engineered the right-click. By right-clicking, you’re summoning the image into existence at a public (though impossible to guess) URL, a rough equivalent of clicking a "Share" button. Google could probably be more transparent about this process, but since the URLs are functionally impossible to guess, you’re not much more exposed than you were before the click.	
327	 DemeRain	 I avoid google when possible because I agree with you. DuckDuckGo is my go to search engine.  But no one can deny the google’s bots are the best a locating obscure webpages hidden in the depths of the internet.  Also YouTube is entertaining.  Those are the only two google products I use.  I only use YouTube on my iPhone and iPad and that account is linked only to YouTube.  Never used for email.  And google is used as a search engine on those devices only on the Firefox Focus browser with the VPN enabled.

332	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; [They seem to be against the idea] (https://www.eff.org/issues/calea).That's a cute bit of revisionism. You'll notice that it focuses entirely on the expansions/revisions of CALEA in the 00's, and only mentions its inception in the 90's in a passing sentence, now why is that?EFF's support of The Digital Telephony Act/CALEA in the 1990s is well-documented (versus, say, the ACLU's and EPIC's firm and wholesale opposition to it); there was so much outcry about it that even Wired did an entire story on it: https://www.wired.com/1996/02/digitel/&gt; Officially, the EFF won't say what happened at that fateful board meeting in July 1994, when it was decided not to oppose the Leahy/Edwards DigiTel legislation on principle but to work to improve it. Participants who speak off the record concede that sparks flew. 	
333	 mcherm	 I have personally met the owner and several employees of DuckDuckGo, and my impression of them was that they were the sort of people who wouldn't pull that. But "personal contact" isn't a means of verification that scales well, and besides -- I'm not that good a judge of character.Why not ask? I'm pretty sure that few if any people have spent more time thinking about the answer to "How can people be sure they can trust DDG?" than the folks who work there... so I dropped a note on twitter, inviting them to stop by and give you an answer.	
334	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; and who is say Facebook wont start doing that in 10 years timeYou're worried about Facebook ordering drone strikes to kill people in 10 years? OK, good luck with that.There's way, way too much real shit to worry about to waste time with idiotic dystopian fantasies. The world is bad enough as is. There's horrible privacy-eroding shit happening everyday. You don't need to toss bullshit about 'who's to say Facebook won't start killing people?' in the mix to muddy the waters and get people who are concerned with privacy dismissed as paranoid kooks who've watched too many Black Mirror or Mr Robot episodes. &gt;  and the NSA doesn't murder people, they have the CIA for that.https://theintercept.com/2014/02/10/the-nsas-secret-role/	
335	 akrash14	 But if one of your relatives shares this link in public anyone on the internet can see it now.	
336	 thereisnoprivacy	 Yes, because they shared it in public.The lesson here is if you don't want your photos leaked, don't take photos. Or don't upload them online. Share them with relatives either in person, or via encrypted chat or encrypted e-mail, not by giving them a link. You can always ask them not to give the link or the photos to anyone, but good luck with that. Having some stronger form of authentication to shared photos will not prevent them from being leaked either due to malice or negligence. 	
337	 akrash14	 That is the point of this post. No link was ever given. Google Drive UI makes a clear distinction of sharing via link vs sharing via a person's email. Only people who signed in to Google can view Google Drive link. Sharing via link is a valid usecase for some material, as long as the users are in control.In Google Photos case, however, the UI Does NOT at all indicated that a sharable link will be created. Only a drop down of emails is shown.  Yet behind the scenes they create a sharable link and email it to people specified. 	
338	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; That is the point of this post. No link was ever given. What are you talking about? The second sentence of the blog post:&gt;  Bellow is a screenshot of my private photo that I shared with one personAre you under the impression that the photo was shared through telepathy rather than a link?

341	 MedianLethalDose	 OS X = full UNIX. I turn off a lot of Apple's crap, this will be a big post...	
342	 mott_the_tuple	 yeah, the more I read this guy's breathless writing, the more confused I'm becoming.	
343	 thereisnoprivacy	 This kind of issue crops up pretty frequently. People realize their direct photo links can be viewed by anyone who knows the URL, and freak out. What they don't realize is that unless their Google (or Facebook, or whatever) account password is more than 40-odd characters (or they have 2FA enabled), that single photo link is more secure than their  entire account. 	
344	 akrash14	 Ok, there is a link behind the scenes. What I am saying is that Google Drive links are protected and only allowed to be accessed by users who are authenticated with Google.In Google Photo case it appears that those links will be protected as well, just like they are in Google Drive. Instead, anyone who has discovered the private link from anywhere on the internet, will be able to access the private photos. No login to Google and verification of viewer's identity required. 	
345	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; Instead, anyone who has discovered the private link from anywhere on the internet, will be able to access the private photos. No login to Google and verification of viewer's identity required.The discovery of the private link *is* the verification of viewer's identity. It's like if your private account password was "discovered from anywhere on the internet", then your post would be as ridiculous as:&gt; Instead, anyone who has discovered the private ~~link~~ password from anywhere on the internet, will be able to access the private ~~photos~~ account. No login to Google and verification of viewer's identity required. The problem here is users not treating the URL as a password, and more generally not respecting the sender's privacy.If you share a photo with someone an tell them it's private, then you should expect them to not share it with anyone (because you have a cache of trust in them to share a private photo with them in the first place). If they do, they will do so irrespective of whatever authentication is required for that particular link, by just mirroring it somewhere else (like on their own public Google Photos album). This means don't share your photos with people you don't trust not to reshare them. It's a problem with a social solution, not a technical one.

349	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 That's good.	
350	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 Correct me if I'm wrong. But AFAIK banking isn't a good idea on tor.	
351	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 Thought so. Sadly, Searx's UI and results don't match DDG or Startpages.	
352	 akrash14	 Your analogy would work if I emailed my username and password to my relatives and asked them to login to my Google account to checkout the photos.	
353	 thereisnoprivacy	 You're not understanding the point I am trying to make, so let's try one more time:when you email a photo link to your relatives, *you are effectively emailing them a password to access that photo*. This is a password that--for the average user who has a &lt;40 character password and no 2FA--is stronger than your account password. So if the first issue is that the link isn't structurally secure, it is. The second issue is that you seem to be concerned about relatives resharing the photo: having a stronger authentication mechanism will not prevent them from resharing it by simply mirroring it.The solution is to not send photos to people you don't trust not to reshare them. 	
354	 RecentlyCroned	 Happy New Year to you as well.	
355	 akrash14	 I c, I guess your analogy works if I pretend like I upload some photos to a password protected folder and then shared a password with my relatives.In case of Google Drive this is precisely the behavior of shareable link. They have another option, more secure, that only allows people with certain email to access the data.In Google Photos the UI of invite by link looks like the UI of invite by email in Google Drive, with the UX of sharable link.Have I know that my photos will be shared via a link, I would agree with every word you said. My problem is the confusion between the two UIs of closely integrated services.	
356	 WSp71oTXWCZZ0ZI6	 OS X isn't based on BSD. Some of XNU (the kernel) is, but this exploit has nothing to do with the kernel. This exploit is only about the NeXT userland.It's unclear at this point whether old NeXT systems would be affected, if any are still in use (there haven't been any NeXT machines built in 25 years), but certainly not any BSD systems.	
357	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; My problem is the confusion between the two UIs of closely integrated services.But that confusion doesn't matter. There are two things to be concerned about: that the link isn't secure, and that the contents can be reshared. The first isn't true (when compared to an average user's password), and the second is not going to be fixed by having stronger authentication. So there is no issue to be riled up about here.	
358	 eixxssxd	 Interesting. Care to name VOIP companies if it doesn't put you too much at risk?	
359	 australian_user	 I use MyNetFone.com.au and siptalk.com.auIncoming calls are free in Australia. Keep in mind these are fixed/landline numbers, so they don’t support SMS. Signal does phone verification. 	
360	 k0d3kat18	 I've tried to use TOR as my main browser, but I find my patience running on end with the ridiculously slow browsing speed. More often than not, I just use firefox with PIA VPN.	
361	 eixxssxd	 In China, they are apparently implementing a social credit system which will judge you according to the company you keep. Will affect your ability to travel or even to get a job.No one knows where this is going. Perhaps it will be Orwell's hell but with the TV cameras never working. But what if it isn't?Having friends who understand how to protect themselves protects you too. On balance, good friends can actually increase your security by helping you not to make mistakes...more than balancing out the increased surface area of having more friends. They'll watch out for you.Taking on risks is often necessary, but taking on stupid risks arising from the delusional mistakes of others? A single post of a private setting can do you in. And you may never know this even happened.What happens to organisms which fail to adapt? Ask any surviving German Jew. Or one of those students in Tehran being hunted down by their security forces. Or a Chinaman who dares operate a VPN. Think it can't happen here?You do need friends. Just make sure they are the right ones.	
362	 akrash14	 At the very least Google should update Google Photos UI to be transparent about what is actually being done. Just like Google Drive screenshot in the article.	
363	 notatmycompute	 I don't worry about it, but who is to say it is not a possibility? I've read and watched too many cold war spy non-fiction books and documentaries in the 80's to know that what I say is perfectly possible, I'm not talking obvious things like drone strikes, i'm talking critiques of FB disappearing. FB has already become a defacto intelligence agency simply by it's massive data collection, not just what it itself collects but by what people make public about themselves, to the point it has become the first point of call for law enforcement and intelligence agencies before they go digging deeper.. I am simply pointing out all it takes is for those at the top to desire power or new people at the top who see the potential.I already think the US/UK are lost as far as privacy goes for at least a generation or two, and all I can hope for is my own government not to succumb to the temptation and follow suit to the same extreme extent  (It's not looking good). Us law gives too much protection to large companies (thus allowing whats happening to happen)and in the UK they have camera's everywhere. I can affect neither country directly so can fight at home and hope for the best....	
364	 TrashMacNugget	 &gt; For instance, they notoriously supported the wiretapping act Digital Telephony/later called CALEA (Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act). If you had donated to them back then, you too would have been supporting it.Could you provide a source on that? Everything I've found suggests they were anti-CALEA.

Participants who speak off the record concede that sparks flew. 	
368	 BlueBugJuice	 How difficult would this be to accomplish?	
369	 ekdaemon	 I am not dismissing your concern.  It is important to know how things work in order to evaluate whether using them in a given case is good or not.  And I'd say that it is true that some systems have trained users to think the web is full of walled gardens... which isn't always the case... and certainly I could see other systems such as Google Photos not making it clear how things work.  Sometimes technical people forget that what's obvious to them, isn't to everyone else.&gt; But if one of your relatives shares this link in public anyone on the internet can see it now.This is the way all websites and webservers and things on the internet work by default.... unless extra layers of logins and authentication are wrapped around them.Facebook is a heavily walled garden.  Unless you set your profile and material to "public public", only friends and people you share things with WITHIN Facebook, will be able to see these things, and Facebook itself asks from you and stores this detailed level of permissions and privileges.  (Plus Facebook gets to see and watch absolutely everything.)  It relies on everyone you sharing things with, having a Facebook account, and being logged in.&gt; Google Drive ... But if the email option is chosen, only users who are signed in to Google with their email will get access to the data.That also means that ONLY people with logins to Google will be able to see your shared Google Drive contents... which restricts you from using this with anyone that doesn't have a google account.  (I don't have a google account, I orphaned the google maps account I originally had when they insisted I give them a cell phone number to use it. Deleted my gmail account that one time that they made everyone's private address books visible to everyone in your address book for 2 days before the outroar brough them to their senses.)Also and in the case that we're wrong, that actually sharing the Google Drive link from within the email with a 3rd party will give them access too ... well people rarely post or share google drive LINKS, because they obviously know that it is granting some kind of special privileged access.A url to a plain photo or page deep inside a webserver isn't "generally visible" to the world at large unless crawlers can find them, which they can't unless someone posts a link to the photo pubilcly somewhere (or unless Gmail or Yahoo or Hotmail crawl links inside their own mail systems, technically private, but technically possible...)The only people that can get to a "non-publicly posted" url (or even webpage, say of photos) is to know the full URL.Unfortunately people are in the habit of sharing and posting links to photos.  So that makes it slightly more possible that when I post some photos on my private webserver and share the links with friends, that they might "leak it into the public".  Also I'm trusting my friends to not share the url, or heck even to copy and save/send photos they shouldn't.  Only the ones they're in.And I do this all the time.  Because it's *so* convenient.  I don't have to worry about anyone having a Google account or a Facebook account or logging into their accounts, or anything.  They just get to see the links I've sent them.So I never do this with sensitive photos.  And if there is something I need to keep a bit more sensitive, I set a separate password.  It's a pain though, sending the password separately to other people.  But it's better than insisting they sign up for Dropbox, Google, Yahoo, or Facebook - just to look at some photos I want to share.	
370	 BlueBugJuice	 Thanks! I'll look into it! If I find a method that is satisfactory, I'll be sure to post something about it.	
371	 BlueBugJuice	 Man, these companies are crazy tenacious. I recently came across an article about how television ads and such are sending out these super low audio signals for your phone and other devices to pick up in order to track you.	
372	 akrash14	 I’ve never seen a UI that offers me to share my password with my friends.Edit: My point is that it's OK that Photos are open to the public with a very secure never going to guess URL.What is not OK (in my opinion) is not alerting the users that they are about to share something private, with other people. The UI look like users are only sharing album with a few selected people. This gives user a false sense of security. 	
373	 smallroofthatcher	 Will that affect how the internet works in other places? ie: Europe?Seems crap is getting out of hand! 	
374	 smallroofthatcher	 I mean if you are not a us citizen I think you can’t do anything. They pretty much don’t give a shit about what their citizens think on this matter, so don’t think you can get too much done if you’re not a US citizen. :(	
375	 AsteroidsOnSteroids	 I don't know, so wait for more answers (and try /r/jailbreak if you haven't already), but I think that generally smart phones and privacy don't mix. But it also depends on what you're trying to keep private and from who.	
376	 OGGrandmaCSGO	 This seems wholesome	
377	 kayfsea	 In my opinion i find it to be the best trade off between convenience and privacy. Sure, IOS is proprietary but Apple's business model isn't based off of advertising it's based off of selling hardware.  Plus they are bound by law to their privacy policy and they've got a much better one than Google. It's not perfect but if you don't want to go the full lineage with no gapps option its a good compromise.

400	 reini_urban	 I was curious about this also. Initially they logged all queries. But after my inquiry about that their manager said that they stopped logging. Which is also at least 30% faster. So the only remaining problem are gagged NS letters, because they are still based in the US which makes it insecure by law.	
401	 akingsley90	 This isn’t everything but some of the things I have done are:-	Set up Little Snitch (firewall)-	Install apps by Objective-See (e.g. KnockKnock and BlockBlock)-	Set a root password-	Enable Full Disk Encryption-	Compartmentalize file access with VeraCrypt There is a guide somewhere on github on securing macOS; it should be one of the first hits. I would also recommend looking at r/privacytoolsIO and the privacytoolsIO website for more generalized information. Sorry about the lack of links and really good information. Hope this helps!	
402	 TrashMacNugget	 Wow.If the text only uses glyph that are contained in their entirety by another single character set _other than Unicode_, would it be realistic to strip possible fingerprinting by converting the text from Unicode to that character set, then optionally back to Unicode?Also, some text editors will display non-printing characters. For example, in Vim with default behavior, the first line reads as:    We're&lt;200b&gt; not the &lt;200b&gt; same text, even though we look the same.The second one reads as:    We're not the same&lt;200b&gt; text, even though we look the same.	
403	 Idas_Hund	 Uploads picture to Google, expects privacy.I'm sorry, but it's just too funny to not point that out. :)	
404	 _kusochi	 I second Kolabnow. They are based in Switzerland (apparently they have great privacy laws), support IMAP and even their server is free and open source software. For me the pricing is fair too.	
405	 garlic_rocker	 Posteo is the best.	
406	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 Thanks for the reply. The fact that they're based in the States is disturbing to me as well. Maybe Startpage is better in that regard. Though I have switched to searX on my phone.

409	 JavierTheNormal	 I don't believe ZWJ can translate to other character sets. But if you just want to strip out Unicode BS, it's not hard. Just another thing to remember.	
410	 akrash14	 More like uploads photos to Google Photos expect same privacy as Google Drive.I guess I am too naive though.	
411	 04a09504	 I used KolabNow for some time, and then a year or so back they had downtime out of nowhere that lasted for well over a day. I jumped to ProtonMail afterwards and haven't had any such problems.	
412	 cBvOh76Zo2i9	 ProtonMail seems to be the best option for now... a large customer base and good support. The encryption model relies upon JavaScript in the browser, however this can be bypassed via the app.Really, all you need is a provider in a non-13 Eyes country that stores minimal metadata. Use PGP for encryption, and voilà!	
413	 smallroofthatcher	 That’s not what I saw but everyone makes their own choice :)	
414	 notatmycompute	 Has it occurred to these people that these techniques are used because some people don't actually want to be fingerprinted?	
415	 smallroofthatcher	 Thank you! You think it’s better than ProtonMail or Tutanota?	
416	 smallroofthatcher	 Yeah that seems a bit of a bad news... but ProtonMail’s prices are a bit high for me. And the double encryption seems a bit too much for me. Isn’t it a pain sometimes?	
417	 smallroofthatcher	 Do you know where posteo and fastmail are based? Do they have PGP? Tutanota doesn’t have pgp wgivh is a pain.	
418	 smallroofthatcher	 Thank you! What’s a 13 Eyes country? 	
419	 smallroofthatcher	 Where is it based?	
420	 smallroofthatcher	 Where is it based? Do they have downtime issues?

423	 gutigen	 Considering generally better privacy laws in EU and soon coming to effect https://www.eugdpr.org, I recommend using EU based search engines. DDG is US based company, Startpage is from Netherlands and there is also French [Qwant](https://www.qwant.com/).	
424	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
425	 math_for_grownups	 There are a lot of places you are behind NAT, sharing IP addresses with other people. Many public WiFi hotspots, hotels, even some of residential cable internet connections and cell networks. 	
426	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 I agree. I love Startpage and Qwant 😁. The only I reason I use DDG on my phone, is because Startpage has a very poorly optimised mobile interface. I use Qwant occasionally. Though I'm currently using SearX. 	
427	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 I agree.	
428	 [deleted]	 [removed]	
429	 TheBrainSlug	 &gt;But if the email option is chosen, only users who are signed in to Google with their email will get access to the data.    Um, hold on, this is what the writer *wants*??? This method makes sharing a photo with many people impossible -it's an Apple-style "use our product (only) our way (only)" fuck you. You want to share photo with someone with a particular email address? Then *email it to them!!!* That way you know that they will have to log in to access it.	
430	 altogether_elsewhere	 The companies that use fingerprinting are typically advertisers or data brokers, so their entire business model hinges on deliberately attacking user privacy.However, security research that tries to find new exploits is generally considered beneficial, based on the principle that it is better for vulnerabilities to be found by researchers and patched than for them to be discovered and exploited by bad actors.

453	 MedianLethalDose	 Tip 1: Open Keychain Access. Preferences &gt; Certificates, set OCSP to "Require If Certificate Indicates", CRL to "Best Attempt", and Priority to Require Both. If you have issues especially with Apple software; setting the top to to "Best Attempt" and the priority to OSCP works.Tip 2: Turn on Filevault IMMEDIATELY.Tip 3: Set the screen to lock immediately of screensaver and disable auto login. Firewall? Why not.Tip 4: Proper firewall (PF, the hidden BSD firewall.) Murus Pro and Icefloor are good to configure it, and it pretty heavy duty, Tip 5: Little Snitch! Be granular, its annoying, but its worth the safety and shutting up homesick apps.5B: HandsOff! Like Little Snitch on steroids.	
454	 maxline388	 Yes, it is unix, but the Linux kernel is open source.So get gnu/Linux, it's not that different from macos, and it is much more privacy friendly and customizable.

456	 MedianLethalDose	 I do like some distros, especially the way Apple is headed. Seeing if I can replace my software right now, shouldnt be hard.	
457	 lugh	 &gt; IMO considering all factors, ProtonMail is the best option ATM.use your words,  what factors?  At the moment we can only assume you are recommending it either because you use if or you are just parrotting what many other people also blindly say.	
458	 maxline388	 I suppose you like how macos looks, I'd recommend getting elementaryos if you want it to look like macos out of the box. But if you want to customize it, get Ubuntu or Debian, those are really nice with a lot of support. And yeah, most software can be replaced. Don't quote me on this but I think that if certain software exists on macos, then it should have a port for gnu/Linux.Oh and you can use wine for applications that run on Windows and you can use anbox to run Android applications.

480	 ABaseDePopopopop	 Posteo. Based on Germany. Good track record and nice company culture. Doesn't support personal domains. I use them, it's good.Mailbox.org. Based in Germany. Runbox. Based in Norway. Slightly more expensive.Fastmail. Based in Australia and the US, which isn't as good. Significantly more expensive. Great software though.Protonmail. Based in Switzerland. Doesn't support IMAP (deal breaker for many people). Quite expensive. Has some fancy encryption features, but they're not really useful if you communicate with people who don't use them (so all your messages basically). Is also the most prominent "privacy-conscious" service now which makes them a primary target, I fear it ends up like Lavabit (and I want my email service stable).	
481	 hbzdjncd4773pprnxu	 They are not using PGP. So they can encrypt your contacts, from, to, the email object.... ProtonMail its just plain text... both email provider are encrypted at rest (thats the way emails work). In transit = no security from any email provider. Switzerland (Protonmail) laws are nightmares in term of privacy (yep they have new laws in 2018)Im using protonmail right now but will go for tutanota for better security and legislation if tutanota get new short domains. I stay with proton just for convenience

486	 [deleted]	 I don't create gmail, because that would mean agreeing to their ToS. That's something I would never do.Google also has all the means in the world to fingerprint your devices and find out it's all you. From their perspective it would all be the same account.I don't use masking, I simply create new accounts. I won't work for cryptocurrency exchanges because you have to identify yourself to there by name anyway, as far as I understand it, but I also use Tor for almost all of my web browsing. That way neither e-mail services nor other sites can identify and track me through my activity on their services.	
487	 656d7074797368656c6c	 ProtonMail does support IMAP with the ProtonMail Bridge, though only on Windows at the moment.Also... your point about their prominence. It's essentially an argument for security through obscurity, which in my opinion is a very  misguided strategy.

492	 pard68	 That's an issue with Firefox as well. 	
493	 space_crossroads	 I was considering Posteo as a new provider, but it looks like mailbox.org has better privacy policy. There is no point for me going for Tutanota or Protonmail, when no one else will be using it. And I need IMAP set-up. So my mails won't be any safer, but at least I know data won't be sold to 3rd parties

501	 vinnl	 Similar: https://panopticlick.eff.org/	
502	 bigbirdtoejam	 Canvas defender (Firefox) defeats the browser fingerprint, but not the Computer Fingerprint hash.  I guess this means that the computer fingerprinting techniques do not include use of &lt;canvas&gt;.Anyone know of a firefox addon that can introduce entropy or selectively disable WebGL?Edit: Sorry for not googling that for myself. WebAPI Manager is an addon that can disable many of the features required for cross-browser fingerprinting.	
503	 bradmont	 Honestly, used car salesmen and lawyers get a bad rap. Most of them are ok folks, but with a minority of slimeballs mixed in.Advertising industry goons on the other hand....	
504	 BlueZarex	 And workplaces and universities. That right there changes minority to majority for 8 hours a day at least for the workplace. Browsing by single public internet address by one user is pretty rare. The exception is mobile phones, but VPN or Orbot can help with that at least. For others, I would recommend Decentraleyes as an additional plugin. It blocks the loading of remote google fonts which is one of the big google trackers. The usual plugins I like are:No scriptUnblockDecentraleyesHttps everywhereAlso, if a Firefox user, change your cookies settings to "Allow" / "Block 3rd party always" / "remove cookies" / "when I close browser". The reason is that blocking all cookies makes for a painful experience, but when you allow cookies without customizing the settings like above, it will by default allow all cookies including 3rd party and never delete them. This allows session only cookies that get deleted when you close the browser which is a little better.

514	 BRJNJNQJDPSMYYY	 Here:https://github.com/drduh/macOS-Security-and-Privacy-GuideAlso, use Little Snitch. Use Tor Browser.	
515	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
516	 BRJNJNQJDPSMYYY	 And why?	
517	 KJ6BWB	 &gt; We propose a (cross-)browser fingerprinting based on many novel OS and hardware level features, e.g., these from graphics card, CPU, audio stack, and installed writing scripts. Specifically, because many of such OS and hardware level functions are exposed to JavaScript via browser APIs, we can extract features when asking the browser to perform certain tasks through these APIs. The extracted features can be used for both single- and cross-browser fingerprinting.&gt; The new tracking technique relies on JavaScript code that's compact enough to run quickly in the background while visitors are focused on a specific task, such as reading text or viewing video. The researchers have launched [this website](http://www.uniquemachine.org/) to demonstrate the techniques and have released the corresponding source code [here](https://github.com/Song-Li/cross_browser). In a test that collected 3,615 fingerprints from 1,903 users over a three-month period, the technique was able to successfully identify 99.2 percent of users. By contrast, a single-browser fingerprinting technique dubbed AmIUnique, had a success rate of 90.8 percent.

526	 dcdevito	 I don't discredit this article, but most people (me included) share photos from Google Photos via the mobile app, which requires a Google account (albeit there is an option to share via URL but it's rather cumbersome and easier to share with other Google accounts anyway) - so there's no link that gets shared. And at any point I can remove people from photos/albums I share. The desktop link is rather legacy and I can see Google deprecating it soon anyway. TL;DR not a big deal.

540	 darps	 uMatrix has a much nicer interface and lets you fine-tune which type of element should be allowed from which source. For instance, there are some sites where I allow JS from certain sources, because that's what they use to check for ad blockers, but no frames or embedded media, because that's how they actually deliver ads.  Noscript, for all else it does well, in this regard only lets you enable/disable the whole URI for all types of content. 	
541	 dcdevito	 No. My point is...the consequences of a leak from Equifax have far more substantial potential damage to us vs a company like Tesla, who's data will comprise of where we drive. 	
542	 darps	 It's not like there's zero legitimate use for CDNs. For all the GPU tests the site does it actually makes a lot of sense. 	
543	 theantnest	 That's like saying, "I'm not concerned about swimming with sharks because snakes bite".	
544	 darps	 "Let's try to find the most effective way to exploit people's emotions and weaknesses for profit" has been the core of advertising since its inception. I'm with you on that. 	
545	 theantnest	 Also, I personally think the Intel ME vulnerability, or even the, surprisingly mostly unpatched, Krack wifi vulnerability is a lot more far-reaching than the Equifax leak which only affects US citizens. So by your logic, we should all trust Equifax, because there are things worse than that.	
546	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 I don't really have much knowledge about the workings of the SearX source code. But what makes me trust it over DuckDuckGo or even Startpage is that searx.me is completely open source.	
547	 TangoWhisky	 Please don't use the word "now" when the article is from Feb 2017.	
548	 darps	 What IPv4 connections do you use where you're not behind NAT, mobile aside? It's been the standard for decades for almost every type of WAN-connected network there is. I haven't seen a PC with a direct wired link in a long time. 	
549	 gumnos	 /me looks around house.NAT router feeds internet to over a dozen laptops/tablets/phones, allocated across multiple residents. While most homes won't have quite as many computers, I imagine that many family-of-four type homes have tablets/phones and a computer or three behind their NAT. It can get close, but NAT is used at pretty much every (non-dialup) home endpoint and not a unique identifier for a person. Or even a machine (seeing my DHCP has handed out the same internal IP address to multiple MAC addresses over the course of time)

565	 eixxssxd	 Why do you feel that AES-256 isn't sufficient? Just askin.....	
566	 darps	 Click on the green/red icon and the umatrix window will appear. First of all, settings are the cogwheel in the top left. I recommend colorblind mode, looks nicer. Next, the interface itself. The rows are the sources that the site you're on is trying to load stuff from; their URLs listed on the left. The columns are the type of media it's trying to load. The numbers in the cells are the number of elements respectively. Yellow (green) means permitted, blue (red) means blocked. You can change that by clicking at the top (allow) or the bottom (block) of any cell. You can also allow/block entire sites by clicking on the first column (the URLs) directly. After changing something, you'll notice a few new buttons appearing. The important bit here is that all changes you make are temporary (until you close the tab), allowing you to experiment without actually changing the allow/block lists. Once you're happy with how a site works, click the lock symbol on the top, and umatrix will remember your changes permanently. Click the eraser to revert all changes that haven't been saved yet. That's pretty much it. 	
567	 eixxssxd	 mailbox.org is a competent outfit. I worry about German laws tho. They were once a privacy beacon but seem to be transitioning to the dark side similar to the US government.	
568	 OnlyWallsOfText	 Websites can silently detect if you have an adblocker enabled, and in most cases they use that knowledge to help fingerprint your browser.As for canvas fingerprinting, it would make it a harder to fingerprint, but not impossible.

576	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
577	 garlic_rocker	 Unlike most other encrypted email services, they support standard protocols (IMAP and Cal/CardDAV) for syncing, so you're free to use whatever you want, and can easily sync your email so you can leave at any time. Instead of some proprietary eventually-we'll-open-source-it tech like ProtonMail, they wrote and had audited a GPL extension for Postfix (which is standard email server software).On top of that, their commitment to privacy goes beyond just tech. You're able to pay anonymously, their business model is entirely sustainable (and has been for close to a decade), and all their electrical needs are met with clean energy too.Finally, again unlike ProtonMail (which was a serious contender for me but lost), they help support federated end-to-end encryption via PGP by actively supporting Enigmail and other client and browser based PGP software. In addition to be an early supporter of DANE and having a TLS-sending guarantee feature, they recently added Autocrypt support too.Edit: forgot to add that they support LibreJS, and are recommended by the FSF, so if you're a free software supporter, they're a great choice.

CentOS, RHEL, Ubuntu, Debian, etc. Can't really go wrong with any of them.If you're looking for a nice desktop experience, Ubuntu is still my favorite in that regard.Hardening Linux is a total rabbit hole, in the sense that there's always something more you can do, to the point where it's a full time job for a lot of us IT people.A good getting started point is https://www.computerworld.com/article/3144985/linux/linux-hardening-a-15-step-checklist-for-a-secure-linux-server.htmlHardening Linux is from the focus of preventing hackers and the like from getting access to your Linux server, but a lot of that will also go towards privacy and security for the home user as well.Visa, Mastercard and the other big credit card companies got together and made a set of security standards called PCI-DSS that have to be checked off before they'll let companies handle credit card data. It's not everything you can do, but it is fairly comprehensive - a good quick overview of that can be found here - https://linux-audit.com/linux-systems-guide-to-achieve-pci-dss-compliance-and-certification/There's also a ton of browser related stuff that you should look into that relates to how much information you're disclosing to others when you browse the internet, but as that's not my area of expertise, I'll let others speak to that end.

590	 FeatheryAsshole	 one thing to consider: if you customize your system to increase privacy, you will not want to reinstall it every year. fedora does a full release every year, whereas debian (stable) only does a full release every 2.5 years. that is in favor of debian, IMO. on top of that, debian de-blobs the kernel and confines proprietary software to the 'non-free' repo, which enables you to pick and chose which proprietary software you want on your system .

That means no "sneak and peaks"; the US can't force them to hand over info about me without a warrant or force them to shut down.Other nice perks are that it supports standard protocols, so although you can use the Yandex app on mobile devices to do email, you don't have to. The built-in mail clients will work just as well. They also offer Yandex Disk, which is comparable to Google Drive, only coming up 1 GB short on the free plan, I think.I don't have any trouble with spam or connectivity issues.

(Self-hosted server + hosts file but it'd take days to set up)Tldr, you can, but it's EXTREMELY inconvenient and an extension eases it up A LOT.(NoScript also has more protections with it)(If you don't like NoScript, try μMatrix, i prefer it, but I keep both extensions.)Edit: I probably should have enphasised it more: **don't do what I told you, extensions ease it up A LOT and make it secure**	
595	 darsestheus2	 My understanding of mega.nz is that the encryption key is 'stored' in the URL hash (the part after #). This part is never sent in the request to the webserver. DPI/SSL content scanning is thus not able to retrieve the key from the URL. You must note however that obtaining the URL usually comes from a website which would be recorded. So if you want the actual file you should not look for mega.nz HTTP requests, but the content of other websites which contain the full URL.

The vast majority of everyday emails pretty much anyone receives aren't going to be encrypted by the sender, they're just going to be sitting on the provider's email server in cleartext. 	
600	 ffixUwyENYimR4Hi	 It's always better to use multiple at a time, just in case a vuln is found in one. For my more private files I also use AES-Twofish-Serpent.	
601	 ffixUwyENYimR4Hi	 If your threat model doesn't include very powerful governments with active attacks then it's fine. AES-256 should still stand strong for at least a few years.

604	 ffixUwyENYimR4Hi	 Best bet would be to encrypt it, use some free space fill-up utility, use a superwipe (from recovery), reencrypt it and do it until you feel safe.	
605	 ffixUwyENYimR4Hi	 Firefox, IceCatMobile or Fennec F-Droid.If you prefer a more Chrome-like UI, then Brave. It's also easier to use.

618	 SexyGirlFrdFartsAlot	 For newbies try https://simplednscrypt.org/  it has a nice GUI &amp; very easy to use and understand. It's basically DNScrypt for dummies 	
619	 Longent	 Nope, my threat model is probably extremely small. I'm much more concerned about negligent employees with access keys, which is why zero-knowledge is a must (whether or not it's truly zero knowledge I'm not sure - but you can't go through life trusting *no one*, can you?). If AES-256 were to be cracked in the next few years, what do you think data storage services that rely on AES-256 would do? Do you think customers have time to pull their data before it was put at risk? 	
620	 Longent	 I feel the same way - but I wonder if using all three is worth the trade off of having many reasonably secure, and much more convenient, backup solutions taken off the table. If the difference between AES-256 and all three together is marginal for those of us who aren't internationally wanted criminals, I don't want to give myself a hard time for no real reason. 	
621	 iamapizza	 Yep excellent questions and it now it hits upon the slightly philosophical side of things.  Even if you meet those developers in real life to exchange public keys, how can you be sure it's truly them?  GPG talks about this in [web of trust](https://www.gnupg.org/gph/en/manual/x547.html).Ultimately your call on whether you trust that key and the source of that key. One way this can be mitigated is for developers to put their public keys in many places.  So if you go back to the verifying page you'll see all these different ways to get the key.  One is on 'pool.sks-keyservers.net', one is on [their website](https://keepassxc.org/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc), one is on [github](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxreboot.github.io/blob/master/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc).  Many people also add it to [Keybase.io](https://keybase.io/), though the keepassxc developers have not done that.  One thing to point out about the key on github, you will see that the git commit has also been [PGP signed](https://github.com/keepassxreboot/keepassxreboot.github.io/commits/master/keepassxc_master_signing_key.asc) - it's the Verified text on the right hand side.  Not signed with the same key, but signed by one of the devs 'TheZ3ro' and their PGP key.   Having that git history for that file is helpful.

629	 youflurt	 Back in the Usenet days, around the late '80s, I had read somewhere/somehow a few years before about how classified information would be printed with tiny differences in spacing to track leaks to foreign adversaries. In some newsgroup, I happened to mention I had read about this technique, which while obvious once you think of it was apparently not well known. Certainly by that time, it was very well known to the KGB.Months after my public comment, I got a phone call from an AT&amp;T inventor who was prosecuting a patent on the same technology. They were very interested where I had read about the technique in the public literature. Alas, I could not remember where I had read that little factoid so I wasn't much use to them. It was disturbing to them that their patent claim was out in the open literature somewhere, but they could not find it

639	 darps	 Well, most of these services are hosted by ad servers elsewhere, not the site itself, for performance and convenience reasons (the ad company collects the data). For one of the biggest ad/tracking networks out there, Google Analytics, that would be *google-analytics.com*. This will show up in the list of URLs, e.g. on Twitter: https://i.imgur.com/z7je9XO.pngYou can see that it's trying to load a script. That won't be enough to profile your PC so precisely as described above, of course. It's red, because uMatrix has default block lists for the well-known URLs that deliver ads and track users. If the technology described above would be employed, it would most likely be by external services, and uMatrix will tell you about them and block most of them by default. If it is hosted directly by the site you're visiting, it would likely show up as "frame" or "media" in the first row, where the site itself is listed. You can change the default setting for any site in the "1st-party" row. You could disable "media" for any site, and only reenable it for specific sites the row below. 	
640	 quantum_dan	 Okay, thanks.  That's what I expected but I thought I'd check.	
641	 JavierTheNormal	 Turn off JS and they can't access any APIs. That should be the default.	
642	 JavierTheNormal	 Uh, it's the default behavior of uMatrix.	
643	 JavierTheNormal	 FF 58 will have canvas fingerprint protection built-in. For other types of fingerprinting, uMatrix is a great choice because it disables JS by default for third-party elements. First-party fingerprinting is bad but it's limited to that site, meaning they know it's you when you come back to the same site but nobody else knows.Solving the fingerprint problem is a race between paid developers and people who do this for a hobby. We need people to go analyze fingerprinting scripts and post results. Then we need people to submit FF patches to fix the problems.Anyone who does even a small part of that is a hero in my books.

652	 xiongchiamiov	 I'm not sure what exact process SpiderOak uses, but I would definitely recommend them over Carbonite and Backblaze; SpiderOak as a company is very crypto-focused, and has been for a long time.As far as backup goes, I don't consider Backblaze a very good option, because they delete any files you've deleted on your computer after a short period of time; this means that if you accidentally delete some important but infrequently-accessed files (photos, tax documents, etc.), or malware does the same, your backup solution won't help you.	
653	 dickbuttspleasure	 Privacy badger? 	
654	 b7f4c53d00e8	 It's more security theater than security.To get an EV certificate, one must prove that one has control of ***a*** legal entity with the name in the certificate. Not ***the only*** legal entity with the name in the certificate. If I wanted to create "Sync LLC" in some US state (Sync is Canadian), or file a DBA registration with some county as "John Smith, d/b/a Sync", that would let me get an EV cert for "sync.&lt;whatever&gt;" - since the .com is in Sync's name, they'd be especially difficult to domain hijack - but the principle is the same. Just as many individual people can have the same name, multiple legal entities can have the same name. If one of them objects to one of the others' use of the name, then they go to court to fight about it - but the state/local agencies that govern the creation of entities don't generally look beyond their own databases for name collisions. Also see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Validation_Certificate#Domain_validated_certificates_were_created_by_CAs_in_the_first_place for Peter Gutmann's criticism of them.

666	 Peachlemonpotato	 I have read that the smart meter which reads your usage for electric companies can determine everything being used in your house based on an items electric signature. No need for the appliances to even been smart compliant, they got us at the wall. In this way they can build a profile on you that would be very valuable to a marketing company. 	
667	 quantum_dan	 Along the lines of what /u/FeatheryAsshole said, Debian is going to be much more convenient for the lack of constantly reinstalling.  It's also more stable, which is probably a good thing for security.If you're going to harden your system you may also want to consider something where you don't have to reinstall at all--a rolling-release distro like Arch.But between the two you gave Debian will be better if only for convenience.  Both should be fine for privacy, they're both heavily open-source-centric.	
668	 metiis	 I hate Facebook. Probably more than any other company. I get that Google does similar privacy abuse, but Facebook doesn't even have any good services. Google on the other hand has many decent services (although I don't use Google either), but Facebook only has their social media platform and WhatsApp, both of which are garbage. Facebook, because it's simply a giant database of personal information with a messaging option (and I will never understand why so many people use it), at an abusive company's disposal, and WhatsApp because I am forced to use it. I have tried to convince as many people as possible to install Signal, but there are many of my contacts who either refuse to or can't install it. So I am forced to have WhatsApp installed until I am done with school (which is in a few months, luckily). So far I have managed to use WhatsApp without sharing my contacts with it, although I figure it doesn't help very much, since everyone else I know shares their contacts with WhatsApp and Facebook can therefore deduce my contacts pretty well, I believe. Either way, that virus is getting removed from my phone soon.

684	 dcdevito	 That's just utter FUD. I worked for a utility company for a decade and was on the initial core team that researched, developed, and tested software for smart meters. You have nothing to worry about. The "smarts" can read usage but the only valuable piece of information for utilities is your usage patterns so they can better estimate and predict loads further out in the future. They couldn't care less WHAT is being used, just HOW MUCH (power). Not to mention the sheer amount of data being pushed OTA, and the quality of that data. Meters aren't that smart, at least not the ones implemented in the northern East coast US.  The other half of the smarts is how they connect to one another (mesh, if applied) and how the data comes back to the central operating center(s). This is crucial for outage management. I personally ran the outage management system at my company so that's why I was on the team.

686	 eixxssxd	 Separate the cellular carrier from switching by using an "over the top softphone" and a data connection. Was once more difficult, since SIP really wasn't designed for such duty. Nowadays, companies like Twilio, Plivo, Broadsoft, Bandwidth offer webrtc web based softphones - often supporting fully secured SRTP. In theory, avoiding the carrier's VoLTE system should put you at a disadvantage. In practice (studies exist) - it doesn't. They are very comparable in performance when tested. Basically VoLTE and VOIP have equally bad performance vs the old circuit switched 2G &amp; 3G :)Since VOIP will be mandated by all cell carriers by 2020 (you will be forced into it)...you don't lose much by switching to webrtc now. And BTW, that Opus codec is pretty amazing. Nice having good touch tones again.We get our softphones from these folks - but there are many sources: https://anonyome.com/Having an external entity performing your PSTN switching might also shield you from Sim stealing attack. If there is no association by two factor authentication with the physical SIM - criminals get nothing.

689	 trai_dep	 I'd suggest as a reader that you need to hone your argument a bit. What is it you're saying, based on what evidence (cites). Take a pro or con then (nicely!) debate it. That will lead to possibly interesting conversations where everyone might learn something.As is, though, there is no "there" there. So since you're making us approve it, we'll decline. If you want to wait out your account's newbie status so we aren't required to take an action, we won't remove it. But I don't think you will get many interesting conversations since your post really isn't saying anything specific. Let alone, no cites.	
690	 metiis	 True, but do you really think they delete the data if you ask them nicely? Google is built on the abuse of your privacy. The ads may be a little less relevant, but the data stays if you click "delete". You just can't view it anymore.

706	 ffixUwyENYimR4Hi	 I think that the data storage services' reactions would vary depending on how AES-256 would be cracked.If it was through a vuln everyone could use, I'd say they'd try to do as much as possible to try and help everyone with their data as much as possible (I'm talking about companies that actually care about their customers, the other would probably just give tge customers a crazy one week or a bit more deadline to sort everything out)If it was like quantum computing that nobody exc. the governments will have access to for quite some time they'd probably just inform the users in a calm way and give them advice and a lot of time to pull their data.

708	 quantum_dan	 There are lots of options.  I won't suggest anything that's not end-to-end encrypted, so there's no way for the server to store your chat history in a format they can access--they never see it to begin with.  They *could* store it (for syncing across devices and such), but can't read it.One of the most common is Signal; messages are end-to-end encrypted, so they have no access to your chat history.  You can also set messages to disappear after a certain time period.  Signal does require a phone number.Wire, much the same in those features, but it doesn't require a phone number.  Unlike Signal it's for-profit, but its funds come from enterprise users, not your data.  It collects more metadata but the messages themselves are, again, end-to-end encrypted.  It's also based in Switzerland, so it's more resistant to government requests for said metadata.Riot.im has optional end-to-end encryption, and it's decentralized (uses the federated Matrix network).~~Dust has end-to-end encryption and self-destructing messages, but it's mobile only.~~ (closed source, didn't realize that was a problem)Everything I mentioned except Dust is available on mobile and desktop.  Only Signal requires a phone number.

727	 BlueBugJuice	 Let's say it's an average user with a couple of apps downloaded (Spotify, Candy Crush...etc) that aren't malware in disguise. Maybe a few of the apps have the mic's permission enabled.What kind of skill level would be needed to hack into this phone? Average hobbyist to NSA level operative?I assume if the mic is removed, the threat is mostly removed. For curiosity's sake, what if you had a phone with a removable battery? If you removed the battery could you be sure that the phone's mic wouldn't be able to be used even when the phone is off or dormant?

742	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Not only that, but Debian isn't that hard to upgrade from one stable release to another. Or if you develop the skill, you can choose to roll on Sid (lose stability though). Debian also has built-in AppArmor support and while SELinux (run on Fedora) is the strongest MAC available, its on orders of magnitude more difficult to configure than AppArmor. AppArmor is pretty much perfect for a desktop system.OTOH, Debian's package hardening basically sucks. Fedora, Alpine, Gentoo Hardened and Arch are currently the best here (full relro, stack canary, position independent executable, fortify source). This may be only one negative but its a fairly big one from a security angle.I think Debian is overall the better choice for most people, though Fedora probably has more potential if you can master SELinux. Arch and especially Alpine can contend in this debate in the right hands, but they are not as easy for someone new to Linux.	
743	 darps	 Those performance-demanding applets are also somewhat bandwidth-intense. It's not unreasonable if you need to distribute a few MB per visitor, which seems likely as 3D models and textures are involved. As far as I can tell, there's no shady shit embedded.

746	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 [Tarsnap](https://www.tarsnap.com) is solid ([here's the crypto page](https://www.tarsnap.com/crypto.html)), reasonably cheap, and reasonably easy to use. You can read the source code for the client if your wish since, while it's not open source, the source is available to everyone and there's a bug bounty system as well.	
747	 CyberGlitch1710	 Tor, I2P, done! :)	
748	 _fake_name_here_	 They'd better make a rule against promoting any software without reproducible builds then since you can't easily verify that the compiled version is the same as the source.	
749	 tanielu	 A minor qualm, but I'd just want to clarify that it's not actually reinstalling but upgrading. Which when done, retains configurations you may have made to enhance privacy. Probably a better way to explain why it would be less desired for privacy would be that new features may be introduced which may be harmful for privacy and which you want need to disable.However you could argue that this process may be less of a burden with Fedora as it has a shorter release cycle (6 months) therefore seeing to less changes at once, compared with Debian's release cycle (2 years) which would see to more changes.Another argument in favor of a shorter release cycle could be that of software introducing new features to enhance privacy, however you could again argue that there's a greater likelihood of the opposite effect with new versions.Despite all this, my suggestion to /u/Kee-Me would be to consider the software they would like to use and their willingness to learn or time in which in they have to do so, in order to have a distribution that fits them. For I believe switching to Linux in almost any capacity is of huge benefit to your privacy and if they have the desire to delve deeper they can, else they have already done a lot for their privacy.	
750	 Geminii27	 I've tried having such a device created, so businesses could monitor what equipment was plugged into the sockets they were paying to power (or at least be able to tell when Karen in Marketing plugs her space heater in again and causes all the PCs on that half of the floor to brown out).Apparently there just isn't sufficiently clean information available, even at the socket, to identify unknown items all that well. You'd get usage information which *might* give a rough guess about whether something was more likely to be a fridge or a TV, but that's about it.You *might* be able to do something where you could say "I have device X plugged into this socket at the moment", switch it off and then back on, and use the startup fingerprint to give a moderately good guess at the device's existence/location if it was then plugged into a different socket elsewhere and powered on, but unless you had extremely tightly controlled power systems, you probably wouldn't be able to use that to identify if the device was plugged into a different building's power grid, even one using identical monitoring systems.	
751	 garlic_rocker	 All I can say is that after about six months of daily usage (including ordering from potentially unscrupulous stores, and communicating with companies with really poor email infrastructure, like we're talking not even TLS), I haven't noticed missing anything I was expecting. All order confirmations etc. came in as expected. Whereas these same emails used to go to my "spam" folder by really aggressive filters (looking at you Gmail).I think their anti-spam is primarily done by IP blacklists, and those are fairly effective with really low false positives because blocking an IP takes a lot of caution, and then gets propagated to practically everybody because of Spamhaus and the like. Their Bayesian filter levels are set pretty low. I used to forward my public email directly to Posteo, and was overwhelmed by spam because they couldn't apply their IP blacklists. I had to use a third party spam filter for my public email for this reason.	
752	 Geminii27	 1) A smart device has access to the internet.  2) A smart device is connected to an internal network and not firewalled/scanned/filtered.  3) A smart device is connected to an internal network which is not 100% physically shielded.  4) A smart device has RF wireless capability.  5) A smart device has sound-emitting capability outside normal hearing range.	
753	 tanielu	 This doesn't discredit the rule however. The difference between closed source software and open source software is significant in itself. But yes, as you've stated doesn't guarantee the compiled version was derived from the published source code.Ensuring reproducibility is a difficult challenge, however [many projects](https://reproducible-builds.org/) are working towards this goal as it is definitely very significant. I foresee that with time reproducibility will be more prominent, and with such this sub may include this distinction in it's rules.

772	 xfcgvt	 Don't use Ghostery, they've done a number of sketchy things and have yet to prove that those days are behind them. Disconnect isn't necessary if you enable the Disconnect lists in uBlock or use Firefox's anti-tracking feature (same lists). Thing about blocking javascript and allowing domains as needed because its responsible for most tracking and privacy breaching tools (and very easily leaks your real IP if you use a VPN).Blocking JS will break sites and do it often so you have to be willing to google domains to see if they're needed for the site to work and just fiddle with stuff. Overall its not too hard to get used to. First party (the site itself) will be required to make sites work again and sometimes thats all it takes and if that doesn't work JS libraries and CDNs will be the next most likely culprits. Any domain that has to do with advertising or analytics (tracking) should never be allowed and won't break sites if theyre note.It sounds complex but its not bad once you pass a moderate at worst learning curve. uBlock set to [medium mode](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Blocking-mode:-medium-mode) will block js but so will NoScript and uMatrix. NoScript is the most user friendly but uBlock and uMatrix allow increasingly granular control if youre willing to learnto use them.

782	 r21vo	 Various distros are just tools, if you are not familiar with linux, i doubt it will do you any good. As for Debian vs Fedora, you are comparing oranges to apples - Debian is more suited for servers than desktop. For newbies some Debian derivative is probably a better choice, for example - Ubuntu.Privacy is a broad term, what exactly are you afraid of? Government agencies infiltrating your PC or random internet malware spying on you?	
783	 clayh0814	 There are more options with the 6 digit option.(10^5 == 100,000) || (10^6 ==1,000,000)So at this point the better option depends on the likeliness of the code it’s self. E.g a six digit common code (123456) is less secure than a five digit random combination. (53853) I would suggest the 6 digit *random* combination pin is more secure.

787	 ey3432	 I do understand that the 6-digit code has more possibilities. But with the 5-digit code, hackers wouldn’t know how many  digits the PIN has; it could be 5, 7, 8, or any number of digits.

794	 I8pvAwEzBXOPDuIK	 If you leave no traces at all, you're going to be at the top of the list for special treatment from various government agencies.  If your goal is to fight surveillance in principle, fine, but if you actually have something to hide you might want to check everything for bugs and watch out for people following you.For example, cash has serial numbers, and those numbers are tracked.  No one is going to do that for average joe, but if you're that one guy who leaves no digital trail whatsoever, there are people that would be interested where your cash goes.

797	 therejectedlinuxusr	 Don't use Ghostly. Umatrix (all privacy settings enabled), and Decentreyes are good options. 	
798	 FilettoRed	 I don’t think hackers would randomly guess 7, 4, 5,... digit pins. They would attempt to brute force the pin by starting with the most common (123, 111, 0000, ...) and then move on by brute forcing the pin sequentially (0, 1, 2, 3, ...). By doing this the 5 digit pins would be broken before the 6 digit ones making the 6 digit ones more secure.Edit: a hacker would need to try 10^6 combinations for 6 digits, while if you had a 5 digit pin, the hacker would need to try 111 110 different pins. The odds are still better for 6 digits. Use a pin that is 7 digits or greater to get the best of both worlds.

816	 xfcgvt	 Being owned by a company that makes its fortune on user data was the sketchiest thing but I heard they aren't anymore(?) so that's better. And the words opt-in arent worth their weight in shit when its closed source software because we have no way to know if they're keeping their word or just collecting and selling data anyways. Also even if its truly opt in browsing patterns are a strong personal identifier so someone opting in because "anonymous data won't give me away and it helps Ghostery" are potentially giving up that anonymous but still identifyinf info to a company whose motives are unknown.As I said not beign owned by an analytics company now helps if true but I still wouldn't trust them when there are options that do the same job just as well or better. Using the disconnect lists in uBlock for example. Also doing that instead of a dedicated extension makes your browser less unique so its harder for sites to fingerprint you.

The 1% is innovation, learning, paradigm breaking, and ultimately the fruit of progress throughout history. Damn fucking right its worth your time- dont neuter yourself from the potency of your free mind; the 1% is *what makes you truly valuable as an individual,* and thus you must fight with everything you've got to protect it from corporate and governmental tyrants who would seek to strip it from you for control on behalf of profits or power.

Also then you are dealing with fake money, your money could be stolen and so on, but by having all the money in bank account, any prick then can freeze and close your account, and you will see your money as your dick (it can happen easily if you would be working to bring corrupted companies to justice, etc.).If you will not use any features of modern life, then as i said, there is no point in living in big cities, just find some cave at the end of the world and live over there.

869	 veggen	 They're quite transparent about it. When installing Ghostery it tells you the statistics on what you block will be collected and sold, and you can opt out. I personally have no issues with it, because the ad providers buy back the data on what was blocked, so they can use it to make ads you're less likely to block in the future. That's pretty fair to my ears.

871	 stemid85	 Any surveillance device requires power and carpenters have for years used portable live wire detectors on walls and surfaces to find live wires.But that requires a lot of thought into how such a device would be mounted and wired or you'd end up sweeping the entire room.In the end you should assume you're being watched and that everything you do and say will become public domain in the future.

877	 throwawayacc1230	 A book I read called 'Counter Espionage for the Business Traveller', written by an ex CIA man says this simple thing.Don't.Assume you are always under surveillance, and take appropriate caution not to draw any attention to yourself. Thinking of yourself as James Bond by sweeping the room for bugs, turning the shower on to make a phone call and stopping in shop windows to check if you're being followed draws huge attention to yourself, and you could be pinned by surveillance as more important than you are. Give them no reason to suspect you of any wrongdoing, and they will leave you alone.

883	 WSp71oTXWCZZ0ZI6	 Pretty simple, really.Whenever you need landscaping work done, tell them to meet you at a Walmart parking lot across town. Then, take the numbers off your house. Then, take the numbers off your neighbours' houses. Maybe take the numbers off your neighbours' neighbours' houses, just to be safe.Arrive at the Walmart parking lot and ask them to put on blindfolds. Confiscate their phones so they can't use GPS when you arrive. It would be safer to invest in a GPS jammer, though, if you can afford one.Drive across town and unload them from your van and remove their blindfolds. When they're done their work, put the blindfolds back on, drive them back to the Walmart parking lot, then put the numbers back on your house and your neighbours' houses.It's really the only way to ensure that those unscrupulous landscapers don't put your address in a database where they would do something evil like, I don't know, maintain a record of what work they've done at your house.

889	 uoxuho	 All of these answers are truly awful. Sorry this has happened to you, OP. I think you posted at the wrong time of day when most contributors are unlikely to be online.I have some things to say that relate to the actual question that you asked. I didn't like your question at first but after rereading it, I realized this is actually a pretty great question as it opens up discussion on a variety of different points. So thanks for the question!# Part 1: The Math, Just For FunAs I've discussed [before](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/6m8ug0/how_many_bits_of_entropy_should_i_shoot_for/dk0610o/), we can only measure the entropy of a password/passphrase/passcode if we make assumptions about how it will be attacked. By creating a 6-digit numerical password, where there is no "OK" button, you are explicitly telling the attacker that they should guess 6 digits, as you point out. By giving the attacker that information, their method of attacking the passcode becomes different than it otherwise would've been. If a particular 6-digit passcode is *chosen completely randomly*, and just as importantly, is going to be *attacked using brute force completely randomly*, then since there are 10^(6) or one million possibilities, it is fair to say that the passcode has 19.93 bits of entropy, as is correctly pointed out in another answer.The 5-digit passcode case is much less straightforward. I'm not exactly sure why the other answerer decided that the presence of the "OK" button was worth exactly 1 bit of entropy, but in any case that's not at all how I would approach the problem. By not having an OK button, you create a situation where there are a massive amount of possible passcodes. I'm not sure the largest allowable passcode length on iOS, but to keep it simple let's assume the minimum length is 4 and the maximum is 10 (it's definitely not 10; this is just for the sake of argument). Theoretically then, you create a situation where there are 11,110,110,000 possible combinations (10,000 possible 4-digit codes, 100,000 possible 5-digit codes, no possible 6-digit codes since the presence of the "OK" button means the attacker knows it's not 6 digits, 10,000,000 possible 7-digit codes, and so on).So if the attacker has no idea where to start their attack and they just start randomly guessing passcodes of various length from 4 digits to 10 digits (skipping 6-digit codes), then you have a pretty damn secure passcode (now we're up to 33.38 bits). **But here's the actual important part:** Do we know that the attacker will guess the passcode in that manner? What if they create some probability distribution which aims to account for the fact that iOS users are more likely to create 5-digit passwords than 10-digit passwords, and weights their brute force algorithm accordingly? Maybe the attacker will decide that if they try to guess passcodes that are 7 digits or longer, they will never get it, so they might as well limit their attack entirely to 4-digit and 5-digit passcodes in order to play their odds. This is the information that we need in order to correctly determine the strength of the password, and as you can see, trying to get in the attacker's mind to decide how they'll attack the passcode is not a math problem at all. Our math model sort of breaks down here.# Part 2: Security Through ObscuritySo then, if there's no one way to create a cold, hard measure for the entropy of the 5-digit passcode, then what do we do? In general, people recommend that you take the most conservative approach, and to be wary of *security through obscurity*. In this case, trying to hide/obscure the number of digits in order to create a high number of possible passcodes that need to be guessed is sort of "artificial," you know? As we talked about, what happens if the attacker makes some assumption, like that they'll never guess a 7-digit passcode, which significantly increases their probability of guessing the correct one? In order to not make us feel more secure than we actually are, the proper thing to do is to *assume that the attacker will have every advantage that it's possible to have*. The thing about encryption and computing is that it is quite easy to make things more secure (e.g. just make your passcode longer), so it's not really an inconvenience for us to make our keys so secure that they are virtually impossible to brute force *even giving the attacker all the advantages*.So in this case, to explicitly avoid security through obscurity, here is what I think most people would say: let's not try to slow down the attacker by tricking them and making them wonder how long our passcode is, because it's possible that our trick won't work. Instead, let's slow the attacker down *only* using cold, hard math. Let's create a completely random passphrase, and assume the attacker will try to brute-force it by guessing randomly, but that they already have every other advantage, including knowing the exact format of the password/passphrase/passcode (e.g. assume they know it's a 6 digit numerical code, or when using full-disk encryption, assume they know that the passphrase is an 8-word diceware phrase generated from the EFF list using single spaces between words and using all lowercase characters).**So at the end of the day:** a 6-digit passcode has 19.93 bits of entropy, and a 5-digit passcode has 16.61 bits of entropy. The 6-digit passcode is stronger because hiding the length of the password through the presence of the "OK" button is security through obscurity, and for our own safety we should ignore any advantage created by that. The end.# Part 3: Passphrase Entropy and iOS Brute ForceIn a real brute-force situation, 19.93 bits of entropy is laughably small. These measures of entropy are less useful in a true brute-force situation, and more serve just as a measure of these passcodes' security relative to each other. If you are actually looking for security against someone brute forcing an AES key, you will want to shoot for a passphrase of 100 bits of entropy at the very least. An 8-word diceware passphrase is a good starting place.Finally, remember that iOS devices have additional security measures beyond just the passcode itself. iOS has a tripwire that will wipe the device after 10 failed passcode attempts, which can only be disabled by defeating Apple's hardware code-signing enforcement. Also, the device UID (needed to obtain the decryption key) is stored in such a way that the most practical way to gain access to it is to run the brute forcing algorithm on the phone itself (instead of, say, on a supercomputer); the encryption on each device is calibrated so that a single passcode attempt takes 80 milliseconds to compute on the phone (a long time), so it will take years to brute force even low-entropy passcodes.Edit: minor wording changes	
890	 EncryptedOrgasms	 Well DuckDuckGo does have a Tor hidden service that they advocate to their users, I highly doubt any company that is interested in harvesting data and making money primarily would have such a thing. I can't say the same for Startpage/Ixquick.

893	 stemid85	 Heh good find. You are technically right but I must still point out this part.&gt;The device, a passive cavity resonator, became active only when a radio signal of the correct frequency was sent to the device from an external transmitter. This is currently referred in NSA parlance as "illuminating" a passive device.There are bug sweeping devices that listen specifically for radio. Of course these are pretty pointless today when there are wifi radio signals everywhere.	
894	 G-42	 I've had local businesses add me to their contacts list that's shared with facebook/LinkedIn/etc and suddenly start getting bombarded with emails and texts about how "you know (x) so connect with them on (facebook/Linkedin/whatever)" which I consider grossly unacceptable. I let them know it, and without fail, they can't comprehend what the issue is. At least larger companies have a concept of data protection.

914	 GHOSTCLOUDS	 maybe I misread something, do you use it? did you used ssd installation of qubes? Im wondering about how the performance / encryption is affected. hopefully it allows persistence to save the connection settings. Still If I can get qubes on usb with vpn connection preconfigured, that is huge advantage for me. Wanted to do it with subgraph, but I read about some security concerns and tails is not supporting it.  I just realized that the qubes might not be an amnesic tools like I assumed for no apparent reason except the tails :D

916	 billdietrich1	 What apps are on the phone ?  Are you going to run same experiments with no Facebook / Instagram / WhatsApp apps on phone ?	
917	 externality	 The big question in my mind is why this is is allowed to be such a mystery.  "I wonder if Facebook records my every waking moment without my knowledge or consent?" The answer should be "Of course not, because that company would get crucified if it did."Why is that not happening?  Why is the answer "Gee, I don't know, they can do whatever they can get away with I guess and if they're caught well of course nothing will happen to them."	
918	 TibetanBowlHealing	 The first tab (Experiment Dashboard) is the most important.  It shows which experiment design I am using at the moment, and whether or not any ads have been shown with that design.  The experiment designs are explained on the next tab, Experiment Descriptions.  I'm currently on Design B.  Design A, the complete control, I think has been successfully completed after three days and no ads for the brands.You can see what the brands are in the Brands tab.I have a picture to the scripts corresponding with each brand in the Experiment Scripts tab.  These are the things I say to the phone in an attempt to trigger speech-based advertisements.Anecdotal samples are not necessarily relevant to the experiment.  They are documenting the amount of ads that seem to correlate to conversations.  These samples were not controlled and did not have packet traffic recorded.  An example would be "I talked with some friends at dinner about food trucks, and the next time I opened Instagram, an ad for food trucks appeared."  The brand that served the food truck ad was Wheel Food.All of this is to provide some transparency in the experiment.Hope that helps!	
919	 blacklight447	 Ahh now i see what you mean, i thought you meant they stopped the usb cube entirely, but you meant using it on a usb.Well its possible, but since qubes 3.2 when the usb cube gets enabled, it automatically hides all usb controllers from dom0 at next boot, which would lock you out since your on usb, to do this you will need to allow dom0 to use the usb controller you use, you could also allow all usb controllers if you dont know which one, but mind you that this will expose you to usb during a brief moment during boot, because the usb qube has to be started before it can redirect the usb traffic. You should be able to edit this in a grub config file. I believe there a page in the documentation where you can find how to do this, if my memory serves me correctly.	
920	 adriennemonster	 I'm excited to see how this data plays out. I'm still pretty skeptical that the ads are showing up specifically because of voice recognition, and not from other internet behavior or simply coincidence.

923	 GHOSTCLOUDS	 Hi yes, Thank you very much, will look into it.

926	 billdietrich1	 Don't see how you'll be able to avoid filing tax returns.If you go completely cash-only, I think you'll have to give up most air travel, rental cars, staying in (decent) hotel rooms.If you don't have a credit record, probably you'll never be able to get a loan.Going to avoid having a passport ?  Won't be able to travel outside your country.You can go private to a certain level without too much pain, but then it starts to get bad.	
927	 LuckyStrychnine	 One important thing to remember while testing this is to be extremely selective on the content you chose to use. It would be a skewed result if for example you chose pink sunglasses as a topic but forgot that you searched on your phones browser for pink sunglasses a few weeks ago. So essentially your topic should be well outside the normal things you normally would search for or do online. Advertising is a huge industry and their job is to sell to you using psychology, data sets, and predicting your next move. Shit they may even know what your thinking before you think it! (&gt;&lt;) 	
928	 BlockPigeon	 Good idea! BRAVE ft. INDORSE -- perfect combo for privacy concerns.	
929	 WiiManic	 Yeah, a lot of this seems like Internet behaviour and just that because they spoke about it today, they notice it more. I scroll past 10 ads and they mean nothing, but if one is something I was thinking about today I'll probably notice it much more, when in reality it could have been there all week. Also, seems a bit of a flaw to be using such big brands. I get ads for one of them daily anyways, regardless of what I'm talking about or browsing.	
930	 hbzdjncd4773pprnxu	 Short was the wrong term, weird should be the good one 🤗	
931	 who_body	 And it is beyond your phone.   To have a controlled experiment you may need to make profiles and accounts only associated with the phone under test.    That would better isolate the experiment and rule out any unintended influence from activity on other devices.  In lieu of having one phone and set of accounts per experiment, you may also want to have the latter experiments be supersets of earlier experiments, otherwise you would have to reset the phone to do experiment “E”.

938	 TibetanBowlHealing	 I'm sure there are many other controls we could apply. I'm one guy with a phone and a lot of spare time, but I'm not a university researcher or tech journalist. I would consider these controls to be good enough to get a starting point, or a proof-of-concept. Then someone who is more rigorous can run with it, if they so choose.	
939	 Kotee_ivanovich	 Use a p.o box	
940	 PinkSnek	 element blocker of ublock origin is so bloody powerful!you can even re-style elements to your liking!	
941	 TibetanBowlHealing	 Even if it were proven that Facebook were listening, I would expect minimal and temporary blowback. They're such an institution with no credible competitors that it's almost impossible to see any major change in consumer behavior. I cannot name a single person that changed their behavior after the Snowden revelations, for example. That's not to say nobody did, but the overwhelming majority of people did not. Same with the Apple battery scandal - it's a story right now, but in less than two months, everyone will forget about it, go back to buying iPhones, and Apple will weather the storm.People are also embracing listening technology, like Siri, Amazon Echo, and Google Home. I think most people will view it as a common-place technology.So why do it to begin with? Because I've seen hundreds of people online, including myself, complain about it for years, and I want some vindication. I would expect the worst to come of it would be a Facebook PR statement claiming they do listen but downplay its impact.	
942	 TibetanBowlHealing	 I don't have WhatsApp, so it could possibly be ruled out.All traffic to Instagram and Messenger are to IP addresses registered to Facebook. It's not hard to imagine that one app's data blends with another across their platform.Controlling for which specific app is the culprit would require a different level of controls beyond this experiment. Also, it may not be material to the experiment, if all roads lead to Facebook anyways.	
943	 GHOSTCLOUDS	 I never used riot before but always wanted to try it out, just got an account same as my nick here but without capitals. How do I contact you there?:)	
944	 TibetanBowlHealing	 If you look on the Anecdotal Samples tab, you'll see which ads have been served to me that are seemingly based on conversations in the past couple of weeks.One example - when my mom talked to me about her trip to Montana in the 70s, neither of us were searching about Montana, nor have any interest in visiting Montana. Then a few minutes after the conversation, I get an ad for Montana. I can't explain it any other way.Using Occam's Razor, I can explain speech-to-text ads in fewer logical steps, than I can an omnipotent black box machine-learning ad platform that has near-infinite inputs and variables and serves ads that follow my conversations extremely closely.

946	 cryptohazard	 People look weird at me when I say they should rely more on cash than credit card. Also use cryptocurrencies (anonymous one being bettr of course) when possible.	
947	 Longent	 I'm assuming Arqbackup and Borgbackup work with other cloud providers as well, not just Backblaze B2? What encryption does Arqbackup/Borgbackup use and do they allow you to customize the encryption level at all? The biggest question though is whether or not you can get automatic syncing with these tools. I'm looking for a way to avoid having to manually update my backups. I want a set it and forget it solution that will sync changes to the local version of files without me having to instigate it.

949	 Paranoidsbible	 Depends what you're looking for? I'm helping a group work on a series of guides to address various privacy concerns. You can find most of our stuff @ https://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/libraryWe're finishing up our series on anti-forensic for windows 7, so once done with that we should be addressing the physical aspects of privacy soon enough. For now, we're just focusing on things like infosec when online and build up from there besides a huge backlog of requested guides to finish. If you want anything specific let me know and I'll see if we have anything waiting to be upload, or you could just make a request.	
950	 Longent	 Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the matter 	
951	 HermanBi	 Do not use Google Fotos!	
952	 EnglishClientele	 This is the kicker.  They'll need your address to do the landscaping (or whatever), but they don't need your real name.  If you can pay them over the phone w/a Privacy.com card, your address will be in their database but tied to whatever name you give them.  When their database inevitably gets hacked (which is I think the OP's main concern, not that they're storing his landscaping history), the ne'er-do-wells may have your address, but it won't do them much good from a identity-theft perspective because they won't have your real name associated with that address.	
953	 TibetanBowlHealing	 You're using a Facebook press release to say that Facebook doesn't listen. That's hardly an objective source.Like all other claims that Facebook isn't listening, they never offer to prove that negative. There are many articles written to say Facebook isn't listening, but don't do their own tests, don't capture and analyze traffic, and hardly even interview people with anecdotal experiences.I hope you can at least appreciate that although this test might not prove anything conclusively, that it can at least offer more proof than "Facebook says they don't listen."	
954	 Linkletter	 I think it’s important to work with the other people in these conversations. Did they talk to anyone else about the same topic? Did they (or any of those people) do web searches for those topics? Facebook shouldn’t be able to see search histories, but maybe they can somehow.I think it’s also worth exploring the Stories feature. I assume the entire time you have the Stories camera enabled (even if it’s just to try on goofy face transformation filters) they are listening, detecting faces, and cross-referencing with anyone nearby. Someone else using Stories could inadvertently facilitate targeted ads for everyone else in the room.

957	 SoCo_cpp	 You've basically got a few areas to micro-mange or block: ads, trackers, client side scripting (JavaScript), canvas access, iframes, referrals, cookies, cross site requests, and blending in.Just a quick run down of the less well known ones. Trackers, like Google Analytic, track your access to web pages. They are frequently closely tied to advertisement systems to verify ad impressions and give analytical metrics like how long you viewed, where you are from, and where you hover your mouse . Canvas access require JavaScript, but can give deep information for browser fingerprinting. iframes allow a webpage to embed another webpage inside of it. This is done occasionally without issue, but frequently is done behind the scenes for nefarious reasons. Referrals are part of web requests that tell a website the history where you clicked a link to their website from. Cross site requests are just requesting web content from a 3rd party website being included in the website you are viewing. Do you want Google to know every time you access a website, just because that website uses some fancy Google font hosted on google.com? Disconnect and decentralize strategies attempt to thwart this somewhat, by providing alternative copies of the same commonly used 3rd party content. Blending in is hard to do with all that blocking of stuff you're doing. Your blocking habits, themselves, become a fingerprint for tracking. Yet, you might want to forge info you tell websites, like what browser you are using, by using a fake user agent.Some quick after thought: Using HTTPS whenever possible is important, to ensure the content, which could be scripts you've whitelisted to run locally, or sensitive data you are submitting, is actually coming from or going to who you think it is. Also, it is common to pile some protection from common exploits on top of all this, such as protection from cross site scripting, some ABE boundaries, etc...	
958	 Noctudeit	 I think it's far more important that people be made aware of the data being collected. I see no reason Google shouldn't be able to enter into a contract with users where they "pay" for services with their data, but if the user is unaware of the data being collected they can't know the real "cost" and therefore cannot make an informed decision. 	
959	 v2345	 Depends on how far you wanna take it. Some mice have arm processors, who knows whats running on them.But in theory, sure. I think there was a chinese keyboard that installed something that uploaded "telemetry" to the manufacturer.	
960	 TibetanBowlHealing	 I do get conversation-based ads with Instagram Stories sometimes, but I have never used Stories to post content myself.As for controlling for other people's behaviors, please see the Anecdotal Samples tab on my spreadsheet.  Some samples happen so quickly after the conversation that I think would rule out any related internet activity.  One example would be the Google Home advertisement that appeared at the end of my search for my passport with my sister.  Neither of us had searched anything similar to "what to do in case of a lost passport" because we knew the passport was in the apartment.  Neither of us were planning international travel either.  I needed the passport for driver's license identification.Some samples are so unrelated to anything involving web activity that I would also rule out related internet activity.  One example would be the food truck ad I got last night.  Some friends of mine were talking about food trucks in Portland.  They are from Seattle.  It's not like any of them were serious about food trucks, they just happened to note Portland's food truck square in the city.  Shortly after the conversation, I get an ad for food trucks in NYC.  I'm in the Southeast, so the location is definitely not relevant, but the content was most certainly relevant to the conversation I just had.	
961	 andrei86	 Speaking of facebook listenig, i've stumbled earlier today on tosdr.org.On the website listening to mic is mentioned but only on Android devices, since android users grant the permission at all time. I just wanted to mention this piece of information.	
962	 Bluethulhu	 Discord is closed-source and centrally hosted, and their privacy policy states that they do have the ability to retain and share your information. While this does not necessarily mean they do, it is unknown whether your information is truly private.If you are interested in self-hosted voice chats, TeamSpeak is closed source, free of cost, and offers global encryption. Mumble is similar to TeamSpeak, but offers much improved encryption and security, and is free and open-source software.	
963	 gybaryan	 Which things?	
964	 itwentok	 With these results you should publish a complete list of apps on your phone. I think it is much more likely that some third party app is spying on your conversations, selling the results to ad networks, which then loop back and serve you related content on FB, than that FB itself is doing the listening.	
965	 TibetanBowlHealing	 Huh.  Thanks for pointing this website out.  Interesting note under [Facebook](https://tosdr.org/#facebook) - "The Android app can record sound &amp; video from your phone, at any time, without your consent."I am using an iPhone, and microphone permissions have always been off for Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger.  It still seems to listen in some form or fashion though.  Hopefully this experiment will shed some light on how it does that.  Or if it doesn't seem to listen at all, at least we have some solid evidence to say so.	
966	 TibetanBowlHealing	 If that seems to be the case, I'll check it out.  Right now, it does not.  All of the traffic I've captured seems to go three places - Facebook, Google, and Apple.  I haven't seen any associated with Snapchat, Yelp, SoundHound, or the like.EDIT - Just did a packet analysis of sending audio to SoundHound.  10 seconds was 135 KB and went to IP addresses registered with SoundHound (198.49.100.30 and .31)	
967	 BurgerUSA	 No one who cares about their privacy should have Facebook, Messanger and Instagram "Apps" on their phones. They all do the same thing.

972	 Generic_Green_Squid	 Here is the article if you don't want to click.&gt;Mozilla said last week it would delete all telemetry data collected because of a bug in the Firefox crash reporter.&gt;According to Mozilla engineers, Firefox has been collecting information on crashed background tabs from users' browsers since Firefox 52, released in March 2017.&gt;Firefox versions released in that time span did not respect user-set privacy settings and automatically auto-submitted crash reports to Mozilla servers. The browser maker fixed the issue with the release of Firefox 57.0.3.&gt;Crash reports are not fully-anonymized&gt;Crash reports are not fully-anonymized. According to Mozilla's Privacy Policy, "crash reports include the active URL at time of crash," and also "include a ‘dump file’ of Firefox’s memory contents at the time of the crash, which may contain data that identifies you or is otherwise sensitive to you."&gt;Depending on the URL of the crashed tab, this data may tie crash reports back to individual users.&gt;Because of the privacy implications regarding the accidental collection of data from users who did not agree to share the reports, Mozilla decided to delete all crash reports it received since Firefox 52 when the bug was introduced in the Firefox codebase.&gt;Mozilla engineers took this step because they could not "distinguish between users that chose to auto-submit crashes and users that triggered the bug."&gt;Decision to delete crash reports is a pretty big deal&gt;This is a huge decision as it leaves the Mozilla team with no telemetry data about Firefox crashes for the last nine months.&gt;Furthermore, engineers have also modified Mozilla servers to refuse auto-submitted crash reports from all Firefox versions between v52 and v57.0.2, as they could not tell which came from browsers where users selected the option to auto-submit crash reports, and which came from browsers affected by the bug.&gt;In an age where companies don't seem to care about user security, let alone privacy, Mozilla's decision to delete crucial telemetry to safeguard user privacy is commendable.

987	 LizMcIntyre	 From the article:&gt;*In essence, surveillance, broadly defined, is when we’re intentionally watched, monitored or tracked by a third party—usually for their own purposes.

In practice, we’ll readily cede it for select reasons: safety being the first, convenience being the second.*

990	 maccam94	 Nosey Smurf was a tool that had to be installed via some other attack vector, like baseband hacking (or an attacker with physical access to the device). iPhones have had much better security against baseband hacking for several years now. The iPhone communicates with it over USB, while most other phones directly share their system memory with it.Alphonso relied on people not opting out of the mic permission, it did not bypass it (your link says so).I have little trust for Uber, but I am sure Apple audited their use of that capability very closely when reviewing the app submission. It's not like they actually intend to allow 3rd party apps to record your screen, so there is no user-visible prompt about it. From your link:&gt; Strafach noted that he looked for indications that the entitlement had been used maliciously and found none.&gt; “It was used for an old version of the Apple Watch app, specifically to run the heavy lifting of rendering maps on your phone &amp; then send the rendering to the Watch app,”I'm a software engineer and I actually guessed this is what they were doing when the article mentioned it was related to the Apple Watch.

1002	 TibetanBowlHealing	 The point is not how each individual exploit worked.  It is how larger institutions are able to exploit a phone and use it for their benefit without people knowing.  Much like in politics, the "rules" become irrelevant when an institution has enough money to rewrite them to their advantage in secret.I don't have much trust for Apple either.  For years, they denied or ignored people complaining about their phone slowing down from iOS updates, and were negligent in telling people to just upgrade their battery to solve the issue.  They purposefully exploited their customers through making their software trick people into buying new phones they did not need or want.

1018	 TibetanBowlHealing	 I'm going to attempt once a day around lunch time.  Anecdotally, it seems lunch time and 8 pm are the times where it seems to listen the most.I'll give each experiment multiple attempts with different brands each time.  If one experiment hits with one or more brands, which would be a successful experiment, then I'll have to try the same experiment again with a different brand to show correlation.  Using the same brand again wouldn't really prove much, as it would already be in Facebook's database of advertisements served to me.  The Experiment Descriptions tabs shows the level of controls in each experiment.	
1019	 Reddit4it	 Although the term 'open source' is usually used for software, you can have open source hardware too. You get schematics instead of code, but it's the same concept. Open source hardware should be the very first starting point for security and privacy (see Intel IME crap).	
1020	 AtlasDM	 The thing with facial recognition is that no one has to be watching or even recording the raw video. The software recognizes a face, logs it along with the time and location data, and when when the bus or train parks at the end of the day, it only takes a short amount of time to sync the collected data with a database. Then the aggregate data can be sorted and interpreted later.	
1021	 TibetanBowlHealing	 Getting advertisements based on conversations seems to work quicker than uploading overnight.  Most of the time, the ads are served in under 4 hours following the conversation.  I also haven't seen the phone upload anything to Facebook while the screen is locked, even though Facebook may be open in the background, and the phone is sitting idle for up to 45 minutes.My current assumption of how this works:1. Audio is recorded in small samples, maybe 10 seconds or less, with a very low-quality compression algorithm (like 32 kbps compared to a bad Napster mp3 of 96 kbps)2. Audio is stored in a temporary cache after recording3. Audio is uploaded to Facebook via FB_ZERO encrypted packets whenever Facebook/Instagram are accessed.  The audio upload is hidden in three ways - the compression makes the file size pretty small, it's injected with all other traffic when the app is being loaded, and it's encrypted with a proprietary protocol.I would like to see more details on processor usage if I'm not able to glean anything from data usage and packet capture.

That's hardly an objective source.FWIW, I think it's the most objective source we have, apart from running your own tests to make conclusions purely for yourself. Since Facebook dosen't publish their software, it's impossible to actually prove this one way or another, even with data collection such as this. For example, perhaps Facebook scans for 'privacy oriented individuals' and turns off any features that might be incriminating for those users.If you don't trust a Facebook press release, you simply should not be using Facebook, since you can't trust anything they write at all! :)I can view the press release just fine, but I'm unable to view any of the the data posted, since it seems to be broken and hard to read without js.

1063	 maccam94	 My point is that Facebook is not in a position to exploit iOS to somehow get access to the microphone without the user's consent.  1. Facebook would need to invest resources in finding a way to hack iOS  2. Apple would be mad if they saw it, and since they review apps before they go to the store, they probably would  3. Recording without consent violates soooo many laws that the government would sue FB out of existence  4. It's just not worth the effort, it would require a massive amount of bandwidth, drain batteries noticeably faster, and take an inordinate amount of processing power to find anything usefulApple may be a giant money sucking corporation, but they are very protective of their brand and ecosystem.

It might be the case that you've seen these ads before, but you didn't remember it because you had no reason to be interested.

1073	 socialmediaisbs	 I wrote a book on this, but it's basically saying you're fucked and there's no way to be truly anonymous in today's world. As just one example, Facebook can identify people who don't (or barely) have Internet presences because of how comprehensive their database is of faces.BUT!

Google has never suffered a major breach and they don't know anyone who've been sent to prison based on data harvested from it, so it's understandable that the risks seem remote to them.Not to mention that, while the "you always have something to hide" line is a good argument against making spying mandatory, it's a bit irrelevant to most people I talk to because they know they genuinely won't care or suffer if the info Google has on them is published.

Zero intrinsic value, requiring a human buyer, cybercrime concerns, money laundering and revenue hiding means next to know country to ever encourage it use and are likely to eventually ban it.  Zero intrinsic value means that it is too volatile for use by major business which will unfortunately cause untold problems across a multitude of buyers.  Now that mainstream buyers have some coin, if the hype dies down, people will start to get burnt either from not not being able to liquidate or a potential losses to not being aware they have gotten swept up in an attractive form of financial spread betting.

1086	 Aglenday	 I should have been more specific. Coffee shops where you have many different people browsing every day is the minority and would skew their ability to follow users, workplaces aren't used as heavily for personal browsing as public wifi, but it depends on the workplace I suppose.NAT and internet connections with multiple people certainly isn't the minority but advertisers know someone in the house is looking for a new car, or at baby clothes, they don't necessarily need to know the individual person in every case.

1092	 TrashMacNugget	 Realistically I can't prove you did, and you can't prove you didn't. If you payed someone on Fiverr to do it, the accounts would all be under different emails, and probably signed up for by different people (so IP addresses would be different). Only Reddit site administrators (not /r/privacy mods) could look at the IP addresses anyway.I just think they're sockpuppets seeing as four of them signed up today and their only comment is here, the other one signed up a year ago but their only comment is here, and all of the comments are positive.And if you didn't, why did you delete the post, ddoto? It all seems very fishy to me.	
1093	 ZCCCSDVHV6K3INV	 Absolutely. I since simply started to assume that all the communication that goes through the infrastructure that doesn't belong to me is public, including all of the non-e2e encrypted content and all the metadata.You either control the keys or control the infrastructure, and if you control neither you shouldn't have any expectations of privacy.As far as encryption goes, that's not difficult to do these days. Metadata is still a problem. Same goes for endpoint security:https://techcrunch.com/2013/06/17/encrypting-your-email-works-says-nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden/	
1094	 ndlogok	 yes	
1095	 TrashMacNugget	 While I think this won't be any better than Lineage OS, I think the important part is that there will be physical devices people can buy. This is important because most people (even many privacy-oriented people) don't care enough/find it too difficult to download and install a custom ROM on their phone.This is a good step.

1099	 TibetanBowlHealing	 Controlling for frequency illusion is the purpose of Experiment A. I read the script aloud, and therefore the brands are in my short-term memory, but the phone had no ability to hear me. The controls will slowly loosen with each experiment, until I either exhaust the experiments, or get a hit. Then I repeat the cycle with a new set of brands.I am 100% certain I don't get ads about the brands in the first script. That's part of the reason I chose them. I also follow lots of health-food and vegan interests people on Facebook and Instagram, so it would be anti-thetical to receive ads about those brands.The way you describe it would be far too time-intensive and frankly not any more helpful to the experiment than my current control.This isn't a university research thesis, and it's not tech journalism. I'm a bored guy with a piqued interest. Sorry if the experiment isn't designed exactly to your liking. You're more than welcome to design an experiment that is.

1101	 TibetanBowlHealing	 Conduct your own experiment with your own controls, if you feel so inspired.The other comments have told me it's impossible for Facebook to have microphone access without permissions in the Settings and without a red bar, but it's still been miraculously happening without either of those things. I don't see how a privacy guard would help, if iOS settings are as infallible as others have made it seem to be.

Thought they would fight tooth and nail but I guess they decided to buy instead as they knew they were fucked. Only 10% of Gold’s value is utility and therefore intrinsic, collective delusion is nothing new to the human race. Most gold is stored in vaults and not used in tech or jewelry.

1106	 trai_dep	 &gt;The impact of this will vary depending on the workload. Programs that don't use the kernel much might see a hit of perhaps 2-3 percent… But workloads that call into the kernel a ton will see much greater performance drop off. In a benchmark, a program that does virtually nothing other than call into the kernel saw its performance drop by about 50 percent; in other words, each call into the kernel took twice as long with the patch than it did without. Benchmarks that use Linux's loopback networking also see a big hit, such as 17 percent in this Postgres benchmark. Real database workloads using real networking should see lower impact, because with real networks, the overhead of calling into the kernel tends to be dominated by the overhead of using the actual network.If the threat is more hypothetical or at least limited, either because it requires physical access to a computer or a series of vulnerabilities to be stacked upon each other, it would have bearing on whether or not having every task being slowed down by 2–50%.So I guess I have two questions. How much of a threat is this vulnerability to most users? And, how much of a real-world slowdown does the fix involve? It'll be an interesting trade–off. Can anyone provide any estimates on these two questions?	
1107	 TrueWastage	 I had no idea	
1108	 LifeLikeAndPoseable	 Their new OS will be a variant of LineageOS. So it will run Android apps. Given this, you could simply go ahead and install LineageOS and you'd have virtually what they, more or less, trying to achieve: a Google-less experience.

1111	 reentry	 privacy guard (in LOS) monitors microphone usage at an OS level, so it's impossible to access otherwise without an OS vulnerability (which you may have). However, if you think you have an OS vulnerability, you should be concerned about much worse things than your mic (ie: your account passwords and anything else you may do on your phone). The only facebook-related app I use is face slim, which has made 0 microphone requests. Interestingly, many games do make mic requests, which I found odd.	
1112	 TibetanBowlHealing	 Research Alphonso games accessing the microphone. It's pretty sad that they stoop to such levels to get marketing data.	
1113	 v2345	 Not sure what you are implying. The "technologies" you mention are prime targets for PRISM.Slience doesnt mean anything in this case. I would assume that whatever happened to PRISM, it was either business as usual a few months after Snowden, or it evolved into PRISMv2.

I switched to bitwarden because keepassxc was kind of a pain. 	
1125	 Fun-Home	 Exactly. Additionally, it provides another option in an industry that is inappropriately controlled by Apple and Google. Competition is good. I would love a viable option that isn't one of the big guys. 	
1126	 deel_mij	 &gt; As far as encryption goes, that's not difficult to do these days. With the rise of [post-quantum computing](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2017/12/post-quantum_al.html), we should expect that to get more difficult. We need to use algorithms that are quantum resistant. We should be assuming that when these computers exist (assuming they do not already), that a large number of encryption methods will be busted wide open.

1133	 deel_mij	 Since grsecurity went rogue and the linux kernel is getting hammered without a competent security team, I've been looking into [HardenedBSD](https://hardenedbsd.org/content/easy-feature-comparison).

1137	 LastUserNameDrowned	 The ubiquitous invasion of privacy issue with all of these home assistants really bums me out, because I'd love to have some voice-activated amenities in my apartment and add more as the tech becomes affordable -- stuff like simple internet searches, ordering pizza, controlling the window blinds, coffee machine, stereo, climate control, maybe the capability to fill the tub for me or turn the shower on so it's heated when I get in -- but not at the expense of my privacy. I certainly don't wouldn't want Amazon to have a detailed log of when I wake up and when I'm likely to be in which room. And the FLOSS alternatives I've looked into would take more expertise and time than I have available, and in any case don't seem as capable as the commercial offerings.This is a pretty lame thing to whine about, but it's still disheartening that I can't have a futuristic home without futuristic surveillance.EDIT: Minor spelling errors.

1140	 ishq	 Lol motel6 as if they need more reasons not to stay with them 	
1141	 FeatheryAsshole	 mainstream? no. but you don't necessarily need mainstream, you just need a big enough niche. e.g.: Ubuntu Phone set itself up for failure because it required too many sales to become viable, and because it didn't have enough of "this is real GNU/Linux, on a phone!!". Purism's phone project looks a lot better than that, IMO, since it's set up to actually make use of the open source community's want to contribute to such a project. 	
1142	 Timstertimster	 Find a representative to sponsor a bill that requires these corporations to give users an opt-out button on their profile. You'd then be able to get these services and products and most people would not bother changing the default setting "snoop=on", but you and I could dig through our profile settings and see the connected device, open it's data collection settings, and opt out. It would be no different than opting out of the advertising program, persistent cookies, etc.	
1143	 wolftune	 Sorry, I misread your post. You said *without* NoScript! I just use NoScript.Anyway, you can also do it with uBlock Origin. I'm not sure how to do it easily without plugins, though I don't mind using the plugins. There are a bunch of per-site permissions in the UI when you get more info on a page, but I didn't see script blocking specifically. Might be developer tool settings, not sure.Anyway, sorry for misreading the comment.	
1144	 IX0D9O7U9XDVC0R	 Let me tell you how I did it. I simply installed it once on a spare hard disk I got for the laptop of mine, and then I got so absorbed by different nuances of its design I haven't stopped using it for my daily driver since.I hadn't been much into Linux prior to that. I could install different distributions if I wanted to, but that's pretty much all I knew at that point.First weeks are a pain. Though then you start to appreciate what seemed like pain before, for example, how not easy it is to make a mistake and leak some of your data, and how the system actually tries to stop you from doing so. I think that's great.Also, stream isolation you get when using Tor with Whonix, especially when used with multiple Whonix Workstation virtual machines:https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Stream_Isolation&gt; I know that Debian and Fedora are the two "templates" they use for their "VMs", so I guess installing those 2 OS's would be a good place to start?Both Debian and Fedora TemplateVMs come preinstalled by default. You can also pick Whonix to be installed during the installation process. It is also possible to have all of your traffic going through Tor if you wish to:/r/Qubes/comments/6fyka0/guaranteeing_no_nontor_traffic/&gt; I actually just downloaded Ubuntu and am typing this from there - Should I switch straight to Debian and Fedora? No. Ubuntu is fine.

1148	 JavierTheNormal	 Downvoted; no need to panic. If you're running untrusted/hostile *native* code on your computer in a VM or otherwise, you should make a point of updating today. Otherwise, it's not easy to exploit this through JS. Someone will figure it out in time, but I expect you'll have to run the JS for 30 minutes just to get your computer in a state that's ready to attack. And then they could start *slowly* trying to guess at and read kernel memory.Just update as usual.

1150	 uph	 So their plan was to introduce this "bug" in march 2017, and then when the "bug" is found they delete all the collected information. That gives them less information than if they never introduced the "bug" at all. Not a very good plan.

Somehow I never liked Linux before. And then Windows 10 happened, Snowden story, etc. I realised I needed to make some changes.

1170	 EncryptedOrgasms	 I remember reading a while back that Startpage/Ixquick tracks your user-agent and trying to search on it if it's been spoofed brings up an error message. They may have stopped doing that since then, but I haven't seen anything regarding it.Not all European countries have better privacy laws. Generally speaking, a lot of them do, however in the case of a country like the UK, the GCHQ's surveillance is far worse than the NSA's (Edward Snowden himself confirmed this) and key-disclosure laws always apply. Ideally, Switzerland is the best country to host any privacy-cautious service as it has the strictest privacy laws of any country (Switzerland is where ProtonMail/ProtonVPN is hosted). Thankfully, Startpage/Ixquick is hosted in the Netherlands, which has better privacy compared to others in the EU.

For me personally, the strong stance on encryption (since way before it was cool) and cross-platform support is sufficient to get my money, and the price they charge, while higher than some competitors, is still within the bounds of what I feel no-mess online backup is worth. It may not be for you, that's something you have to decide yourself.	
1180	 uph	 Right, so they maliciously introduce this "bug" in free software and didn't plan ahead or even consider that someone might find it. But maybe they saved the data and turned a few months worth of crash reports into a secret that would ruin Mozilla if just one employee leaked. I guess you're talking about Cliqz? That was announced in advance https://blog.mozilla.org/press-uk/2017/10/06/testing-cliqz-in-firefox/ So in your mind that makes every bug a possible conspiracy?

Then there's the Orwellian [Mozilla Information Trust Initiative](http://uk.businessinsider.com/mozilla-new-initiative-counter-fake-news-2017-8?r=US&amp;IR=T) to build censorship right into the browser.  And that's on top of Cliqz.   Oh, yes, 2017 was quite the tumultuous year for Mozilla.Mozilla clearly wants to spy on its users, but they have to be circumspect about it.  A minor "oops" that collects more data is right in line with this.  Especially given that this as a critical period when they were transitioning to the Quantum engine.  Not some grand conspiracy, as you were suggesting.  It's just a small switch, and it gets them more data.  And if found, they just fix the  "bug".  Oops.

But since it would be commercial, and easy to use, it probably couldn't be open-source. So your back to Catch-22

1206	 LastUserNameDrowned	 Jumping off of that, I'd be willing to pay a decent but fair amount of money for well-made, FSF "Respects Your Freedom"-certified smart home hardware that, even if it didn't for instance make the coffee itself, at least was able to signal a "smart" coffeemaker to start the brew cycle.Ideologically, I'd prefer any software to be community developed and maintained -- or at least entirely segregated from the people who make the hardware. But whatever the out-of-the-box software is, I see no reason why a manufacturer couldn't fiscally justify selling premium, aesthetically attractive smart home hardware with fully-free compatibility. Similar to how I'd use my MacBook for computing other than what's required by my job if it was *nix friendly, let alone free in any way. It's an attractive laptop with a design and OS that doesn't make typing or browsing or in my case video editing feel like a chore. There's something to be learned there. I wish it was able to run Slackware without giving me a migraine, but whatever.Most people want pretty, well-made, issue-free appliances in their homes, so make a pretty-looking smart home controller/nodule/whatever you'd call the ad-hoc devices that make up the network, jam some easy-to-use non-bloated software in there while leaving the hardware free and easy to develop for, hire someone to slap an Instagram filter over all the ad photos ... the money would absolutely print itself.

1219	 Longent	 &gt; Clouberry let's me define the encryption keyWhat do you mean by this? Can you customize the strength of the encryption like you can with tools like Veracrypt? Can you tell me why you trust this service? (Not saying it looks suspicious or anything, I'm just curious).  Is Cloudberry open source? And is it a set it and forget it solution? If Cloudberry offers strong encryption *and* automatic syncing with the cloud provider of my choice (I'm really getting fed up with having to do everything manually), that would be wonderful. 	
1220	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Fedora is currently the best choice simply because dom0 and most of Qubes' default VMs use the Fedora template. I *would* if possible use Debian in a virtual machine if you have enough ram on that cheap laptop. I would mainly just "try stuff" on Debian. Install some apps from the command line, update, practice useful commands (cp, rm, ln, grep, egrep, mv, cd, ls, and so on), break something and then try to fix it, etc. If you hose the install, restore a prior snapshot or clone (both Virtualbox and KVM/qemu/libvirt offer this capacity) and start messing with it again. Fedora you will naturally learn as you update with it, as you note how its repositories are laid out, install the applications you need, hangout in the IRC channel, read through the forums, etc. I would install Fedora's XFCE spin as Qubes uses XFCE for its desktop environment.As far as Qubes itself, I just want to remind you of one thing: you wont be gaming any 3d games with Qubes. It may be possible to passthrough a card to a guest, but Im not sure the security implications of doing so. As far as a daily OS goes, Qubes is surprisingly easy to use. Big changes are coming with Qubes v.4 though, so what exists now with Qubes will be changing.When you get your laptop, go all in with RAM. I find its usually cheapest to buy the absolute cheapest RAM option via the vendor and then get RAM sticks as big as the mobo can handle from a vendor. Not sure on your prospective laptop but be careful- some RAM is soldered in and not replaceable. Qubes needs 8GB to even have a chance, 16GB is a solid amount, and more is better for extreme workloads.You will be pretty damn secure with Qubes as your main OS, but remember that even it has had exploits totally defeating its security-by-compartmentalization scheme... namely via Xen exploits. Qubes v.4 hopes to stop or greatly reduce such occurrences. Even with these exploits though, Qubes has had *by far* the fewest potentially catastrophic exploits.

South America is slowly moving to debit and credit cards, but I don't think there's a single business who won't take cash. You can also pay rent in cash since most people want to underreport their earnings to minimize taxes.

Not vague "Africa and stuff".I live in a fairly developed country in South America and actually don't know anyone who pays their rent other than cash. Most landlords try to underreport how much they make to avoid taxes.Utilities - ALL of them can be paid in cash. In fact a few years ago you couldn't even pay them with a credit card.Taxes - Presuming you pay taxes (this would defeat the whole privacy thing) you can in fact pay them in cash.

I’ll definitely be coming back to this to make sure I cover everything  you suggested.&gt;I would if possible use Debian in a virtual machine if you have enough ramI have 6GB, so I'll definitely try. Also getting 16GB when I buy the new laptop.&gt;As far as Qubes itself, I just want to remind you of one thing: you wont be gaming any 3d games with Qubes.Why do you say this? Is it because most (all?) GPUs do not have free drivers and therefore would present a security hazard? Because in the future I was hoping to be able to connect an eGPU to the laptop (likely with an nvidia 1060-1080). Are you saying this is not doable in a secure way even with Qubes? If so, I suppose I could get an additional laptop later just for that purpose, but I'd rather not if possible.&amp;nbsp;Also, do you agree with blacklight's comment suggesting I stay away from Librem laptops? I ask because this is the first recommendation to avoid them I've read that was not dated from 2015 when they were just starting out, and if their marketing claims are misleading, that would be very problematic.

Because those are the blobs listed on their [website](https://puri.sm/learn/freedom-roadmap/) and they claim that  they are in the process of reverse engineering those blobs and they also [claim](https://puri.sm/posts/happy-new-year-purism-goals-for-2018/) that no other vendors sell “brand new devices” that have the intel Management Engine disabled.&gt;it gives you no more privacy then a normal dell.Based on what I understand, their laptop should be equivalent to any other laptop that runs both coreboot and linux, and that while a laptop with libreboot would be much better, it is currently impossible to have libreboot on any laptop made after 2008. I am quite new to all this though so please let me know if I’m wrong.Also I was under the impression that when (if) they eventually reverse engineer all the blobs, their coreboot will become a de facto libreboot, is that true?	
1301	 HierarchofSealand	 Do you realize how immensely difficult it is to determine if someone is not an actual citizen?Do you honestly believe budget motel chain laborers have the secret to figuring it out? 	
1302	 TheStealthyPanda	 This is interesting to know, I heard if you have your account linked with facebook or etc. they share ads on those platforms. But I do not use any of that so at least that is mitigated, I think. Someone here mentioned Wire, I am leaning more towards that as we would use Signal over anything else, but it does not support voice chat on desktop from what we've tried.How is your experience with Wire if you have used it?	
1303	 ipev	 Nothing.Secure yourself and let them go.	
1304	 caribou16	 It seems to me that it would be easy for any government official to bully a motel clerk into giving up this info.  Reminds me of the time I had a buddy who worked at one of those T-Mobile stores, this was 10 or 15 years ago.  He could look up a stupid amount of information on any customer by just punching in their phone number.  Yes, this was against T-Mobile policy, but the ability to so was a requirement of the job.  In so so many cases your privacy hinges upon the ethical compass of an underpaid teenager. 	
1305	 fluffythesquirrel17	 Yeah, that's a great point. I was planning on asking them to put glittery nail polish over the screws so that it would be very difficult for someone who intercepts the laptop to open it undetectably. I really would not be interesting at all to any government agencies, but I realize that just by ordering a Librem, they might want to look into me.	
1306	 SoCo_cpp	 This is common at almost every hotel. The local police will blackmail the hotel owners into routinely divulging guests' info with threat they will be shut down based on any eventual one customer's drug or prostitution arrest at the establishment. 	
1307	 Kee-Me	 Thanks for the message /u/21vo,I thought Ubuntu is owned by Canonical and due to some issues is no longer recommended as a private OS? &gt; what exactly are you afraid of? Government agencies infiltrating your PC or random internet malware spying on you?Both. Although this is because I read this sub-reddit far too much! 	
1308	 Kee-Me	 Thanks for the message /u/rm-minus-rI thought because Canonical owns ubuntu it is not considered private?I was under the impression that moving from Windows/Mac helped increase security and privacy and was a good thing to do?Is Linux not secure/private unless you harden it? 	
1309	 Kee-Me	 &gt;  I believe switching to Linux in almost any capacity is of huge benefit to your privacy.I also thought this was true.But after reading all the comments in this post it seems and specifically the message from /u/rm-minus-r it seems that Linux must be hardened before it can be considered secure or private?	
1310	 blacklight447	 You cab see the bios like a box with different software inside, one for battery on for the screen etc etc, all purism does is taking the box from coreboot, and using all the contents from the stock bios s box, so you get litterly zero security benifit. And about their disabled ME, they just used a program called me cleaner, which is  free and opensource software that you can use on most computers, even yours. So all you would do is buying a premium priced laptop, while all they do is order a debranded dell laptop from china, apply their own pure os and me cleaner, all stufd you can easily do on your own. Believe me, your way better off buying a libre or coreboot thinkpad, then any of their librems. They are more secure and freed, while also being way cheaper.	
1311	 smallroofthatcher	 Thank you for the insight! This is surely off topic, but what language do you suggest learning for a beginner in code?	
1312	 crchildress	 The CloudBerry client supports 256-bit AES encryption and I will usually get a sturdy password from the Perfect Passwords page from GRC.com or from the LastPass password generator.  Once you get it configured, you can mostly forget about it.  I have mine scheduled to run a weekly backup of my machine and I get an email when it's done.  The email tells you how much data was backed up, how long it took, and if it was a successful backup or not.  If I see that it failed, I'll have a look but otherwise I don't think about it much.As far as I know CloudBerry is not open-source.  They had the features I was after and the price was good.  I was with SpiderOak for a while but paying $10 per month for 250GB of storage and only using about 110GB seemed a little wasteful. Backing up that same amount of data to B2 will probably cost $0.60.   I did have to pay $30 for CloudBerry but it's a one-time purchase.  There is an optional maintenance of about $6.50 per year after that which buys you free updates to any new versions.  Hope this helps!I do miss the SpiderOak Hive; I have replaced that with Syncthing but still not quite the same.  	
1313	 RarePepeAficionado	 You realize that they have deported hundreds of illegals based on these tips, right?It isn't racism to report illegals. They're here illegally. They're breaking the law.  They should be deported.

1315	 nullops	 Privacy of 9,150 US citizens violated to deport a couple hundred people.

And that because they are using only a subset of Coreboot, they are therefore less secure than a laptop from for e.x. Minifree who would use 100% Coreboot?

1326	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 &gt; Lost in the shuffle of a tax bill and a rush to fund the government before Dec. 22, civil libertarians scored a major victory when House Republican leadership pulled the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act. Instead, the House passed a short-term reauthorization of current law that extends it through Jan. 19.&gt; We hope that House Republican leadership will use the additional time to allow a real debate on surveillance in the United States and consider other legislative proposals that protect Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights. They should abandon consideration of the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act in the new year, which would simply continue the erosion of our liberties.&gt; Proponents of the bill falsely claim it “reforms” Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Act — a controversial law used to spy on Americans. The reality is that it could be read as expanding authority under Section 702. It also risks codifying current illegal practices, and it does not adopt meaningful privacy protections that have been supported by a majority of House members.&gt; This is what happens when there are secret negotiations about a law used in secret ways. &gt; The amended version of the bill was posted less than 24 hours before it was originally scheduled for a vote in the House Rules Committee, meaning members would have had little time to read much less vet the complicated text. And, it did not reflect the bipartisan agreement (flawed as it is) that was passed out of the House Judiciary Committee, which has primary jurisdiction over this issue. This alone was enough to make members of Congress and the public balk. &gt; Process aside, however, the bill itself is also deeply flawed.&gt; This is the first time that Congress has had to consider a reauthorization of Section 702 since revelations in 2013 demonstrated how the law was being abused.&gt; Since that time, we have learned that although the government claims that the law “targets” foreigners, it results in tens of millions of Americans’ emails, text messages, and other communications being collected. Some estimates indicate that half of all files collected under Section 702 contain information about a U.S. resident. (We only have outside estimates for now, since intelligence officials reversed a commitment to provide its estimate to Congress in advance of the reauthorization.)&gt; We have also learned that government agencies like the FBI routinely and illegally search through Section 702 data without a warrant looking for information about Americans, exploiting what has been called the “backdoor search loophole.” This practice is in an end-run around the Fourth Amendment and provisions in Section 702 itself that are designed to ensure that the law it not used against Americans. The House has twice passed amendments to close this loophole by requiring the government to get a warrant before conducting such searches.&gt; The bill does not remedy these problems. Instead, it makes them worse. The bill does nothing to close the backdoor search loophole and instead could be read as codifying the practice. The bill simply gives the government the option of getting a warrant prior to performing searches on the Section 702 database looking for information about an American. The bill purports to limit how this information can subsequently be used, but these limits are so broadly and poorly drafted that, in the majority of cases, they offer no meaningful restrictions.&gt; Similarly, the bill places no limit on the warrantless collection of Americans’ communications. Instead it explicitly permits the government to resume its practice of collecting information that is neither to nor from a target, but merely “about” a target. In the past, the government has used this interpretation to allow the collection of wholly domestic communications. The legality of this practice has never been examined outside of the secret court that oversees surveillance under FISA, yet this bill would likely be read as congressional approval of this controversial practice.&gt; Even more, the bill — potentially inadvertently — suggests that the government may be able to engage in even more expansive “about” collection that permits collection of communications that may only make a generic reference to a person. In the past, “about” collection involved acquiring communications that contained a specific “selector” associated with a target, such as an email or phone number.&gt; Leadership unsuccessfully tried to jam this bill through Congress at the end last year in advance of the expiration, though intelligence officials indicated that they believe that they can continue surveillance under Section 702 until April 2018.&gt; With enormous constitutional issues at stake, members of Congress should not simply accept this flawed legislation. Instead, they must oppose it and force leadership to take up real reform of the law before Jan. 19.

1347	 frenchmontanatheman	 Social engineering is the best I have found. Register under a fake name, use cash if possible to secure the room. If they ask for ID, tell them you don't have any and be very nice about it. Most of the time, they won't care, but in the rare case, show them your "badge from work" which you can get here: https://www.quickidcard.com/ It helps to be part of their honors program, they won't bother you if you've already spent a lot of money at their place.If all else fails, I found switching my name around on the reservation works pretty well. If my name is John Edward Smith, I may change it to John Edward, Smith Edward, Edward Smith, etc. In the US, all of the states have different standards for driver's license, so you can convince the person at the front desk that your state puts the name in a weird order. Far as payment, just ask your credit card company for an authorized user and add your name of choice.	
1348	 RarePepeAficionado	 &gt;The Fourth Amendment (Amendment IV) to the United States Constitution prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures.The government didn't force them to turn over records.

1352	 HierarchofSealand	 Because there is no possibility of systemic or human errors with ssns, and your average motel 6 worker has the resources and know-how to run that check. /sYou can't invalidate a potential US citizens rights because  they *might* be undocumented. They must be assumed a citizen until there is no doubt that they are not.There is zero room for error. 	
1353	 RarePepeAficionado	 Who said the Motel 6 employee would be running that check?	
1354	 frenchmontanatheman	 You should be less worried about your address being in the databases and more worried about your name being tied to your address. If your address is in a bunch of databases with 20 different names, who cares? Whenever you have a company come to your home, give them a different name. If done correctly, you will actually help yourself by giving companies your address because it will be so obscured that advertisers won't know who to target.	
1355	 Longent	 So the way it basically works is that CloudBerry creates a backup on a scheduled basis and then sends that backup to your cloud provider of choice, updating/replacing the old backup in the cloud? And the cloud never sees the data in an unencrypted format? The fact that it isn't open source (and that I can't find much talk about CloudBerry on Reddit) is a little concerning, but I'll do some research of my own. If it's an option I feel comfortable using, it sounds like a great solution to my problem! 	
1356	 HierarchofSealand	 ... quote:&gt;Why are people constructing these conspiracy theories when the reality is that some good Americans called the cops on a bunch of illegals?You did. You claimed that this is a case where 9105 people's information were turned over voluntarily to the police, but that's okay because they were illegal. A motel 6 worker cannot possibly know that. 	
1357	 r21vo	 Ubuntu is still opensource, however, it's far more usable for newbies compared to other distros with minimum effort. People don't use standard debian on desktops because it purposely slows down adaption of new software versions too much (for typical linux gurus at least). The point is - if you're not a linux expert and try to use complex solutions (like arch, alpine, gentoo, any bsd), you'll end up crawling back to windows because "nothing works". Regards to mitigating threats - I have bad news for you, most of the spying happens outside your pc and you have no control over it.	
1358	 RarePepeAficionado	 &gt;You did. Where?  Can you quote where I said exactlyy that?&gt;You claimed that this is a case where 9105 people's information were turned over voluntarily to the police, but that's okay because they were illegal.No, I said it's okay because they have no reasonable expectation of that data remaining private.  It's the motel's data, not theirs.&gt;A motel 6 worker cannot possibly know that.Cool story.  If I call in a tip on a suspicious individual do I have to first go make sure that he's breaking the law?  The answer is "no."Why are you defending criminal behavior so much?  All illegals should be deported, period.  All people who harbor criminals should be punished, period.**Stop breaking the fucking law.**	
1359	 rm-minus-r	 Out of the box, Linux is certainly more secure than Windows and I say this as a Linux sysadmin who used to be a Windows sysadmin.While Canonical publishes Ubuntu, it's still Linux, just with a nicer GUI / desktop than most other versions of Linux. There was the whole [Unity controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_\(user_interface\)#Privacy_controversy) with older versions of Ubuntu (12.04 and 14.04), but in the most recent release (16.04), is no longer an issue as far as I know. Personally, at the time, I thought it was overblown. I never used the Unity search when it was around because honestly it wasn't very good compared to using Google. Your mileage may vary.As far as privacy goes, it depends on what you mean by that. Linux isn't uploading anything to anyone in the background like Windows might, but aside from that concern, what do you consider privacy to be?	
1360	 smallroofthatcher	 I meant company wise, their HQ, but I'm going to check :) 	
1361	 rm-minus-r	 Out of the box, Linux is far more secure than Windows. Linux (aside from the brief Unity controversy with older versions of Ubuntu) is not uploading any information to anyone in the background like Windows has been known to do.In general, I would say that I consider Linux to be more private out of the box than Windows, but it can be even more so if you take a day or two of your time to lock it down even further.

The filenames are in the clear but the contents are gibberish without the encryption key.  The cloud providers do not see any file contents in the clear.  I do see an option to encrypt the file names in the CloudBerry client but I must have left it unchecked or they added that feature recently.  In this scenario, I guess we do have to trust CloudBerry to use our key properly.

If your OS supports different kernels in the official repositories try to get a 4.14.11 or later kernel (or 4.9.74 for a long term service kernel) and you should be safe from Meltdown (the one you are mentioning in your OP). If you run Arch, its already done. Im sure Debian and others will be along shortly with patched kernels to beat this one.If you use Windows, you wait for patch tuesday and you should get it then. No idea on MacOS. Avoid javascript as much as possible until you have a patch. You can enable for sites you trust, but I would suggest Ublock Origin in medium mode or Umatrix. The key is to block third-party scripts- presumably javascript from sites you trust will be fine, but third party is often beyond their control. On Torbrowser, simply do not allow javascript until this is fixed period. You really shouldn't allow it anyways, but especially not right now. As another user mentions, it takes awhile to initialized (like 10-30 minutes), so I suppose another strategy would be to quickly read sites with javascript and close before they have a chance to hack you. This is getting pretty paranoid though.It sucks though I do certainly agree :(	
1425	 lnplum	 Yes, it's probably not the best idea.	
1426	 tejmin	 &gt;So why did you then assume I was talking about having the hotel employee do the thing I said ICE should be doing?You never said ICE should be doing it, thusly one would assume the hotel employee would.&gt;Is that how you react every time someone makes you look silly on the Internet?You didn't. You just throw shit on the wall to see what sticks. Thusly, you are a waste of carbon, and should let something else use it.	
1427	 joshharkema	 This overwrites as well, yes it's working now. 	
1428	 joshharkema	 Yes, I need to add a loop condition. 	
1429	 JeffersonsSpirit	 "Its not easy" is a far cry from "its not possible." Plenty of people load up a page along with 30 others and then eventually get around to reading it; there are many times when 30 minutes or more elapse before we get around to checking out a page. Given that a patched kernel (4.9.74, 4.14.11 or greater, etc) completely solves this problem, I think its a damn good idea to find the fastest way to have this dealt with on your local system.That such a delay could allow ring 0 access is a huge deal and absolutely deserves peoples eyes on the issue if for no other reason than to allow them to make the choice of importance themselves- a downvote just lowered the likelihood of that happening. Its even worse that it can effectively defeat virtualization containment (even when the virtualization is contained by a mandatory access control option)- this is something with far reaching complications. Fortunately, fixes are possible.Spectre isn't as terrible in terms of impact, but then it can't just be patched- we'll prolly be fighting with that one for awhile.	
1430	 TatchM	 I mean, guest registry information is considered private by Washington state laws. The article states as much. Did you read the article?	
1431	 notcaffeinefree	 &gt;I found a Chrome extension named Toggle Javascript that I am using in the meantime but as you may have guessed.....Most sites break if you disable J.S. so I only toggle it on for unknown sites that are untrusted.There's a flag in Chrome that you can change that "provides mitigation". See here: https://support.google.com/faqs/answer/7622138#chrome&gt;Would the people using KeePass be safer than those using Lastpass? Assuming that these hackers are able to compromise your system and get to your passwords?That's not how the bug works. They can't "get to your passwords" in the sense of viewing a file directory or something. It's about memory address access, so if the password would be store in memory then it could arguably be obtained.&gt;I have worked so hard to make my system safe and read this reddit almost daily and now find out we are all completely exposed for the last 10 years. So all this effort has been for absolutely nothing, we are all living in houses with the front door not just unlocked but front door is completely removed.Keep in mind that the bugs practically require you to be specifically targeted and it's highly unlikely that anything was leaked through sheer coincidence or accident. Code pretty much needs to be written to specifically cause the bug.

1438	 WrenFGun	 Reminders is tougher; on desktop, Nitro is the best I could find on Linux but it's pretty dated. It's better on mobile, where you can sync a mailclient or nextcloud/owncloud with davdroid.	
1439	 JeffersonsSpirit	 &gt; I have 6GB, so I'll definitely try. Also getting 16GB when I buy the new laptop.Yeah, should be enough to give it a shot.&gt; Why do you say this?Because the appvms running under qubes don't have 3d acceleration- only dom0. dom0 doesn't even have network access (to update dom0's software qubes has a special method in place) and you aren't really supposed to install *any* code there.I *do* think its possible to do vga passthrough to an appvm, but there are serious security implications in doing so. I also think you need 2 distinct video cards for this, or at the very least one integrated and a dedicated card to passthrough to the appvm.Qubes is great, but if your threat model is limited and you want some 3d games, why not use a Linux host and a few virtual machines? Its not as secure as Qubes, but its far above what 99% of the computer population is doing, and it would allow 3d gaming easily on the host OS. I think either Ubuntu (a minimal install) or Debian would be perfect for this type of setup. Ubuntu bundles a lot of crap, so installing from an alternate installer (offered on their website) can allow you to setup a minimalist desktop without as much crap (less ram usage, less software to be an attack vector, etc). You will learn more about Linux and security this way as well (if you do your research).Or hell, despite Qubes' recommendations, I think its totally fine to dual boot Qubes and another Linux distro. Use the Linux distro when you need to game, and Qubes for everything else.As far as Purism, there is some clever marketing there, but they are also constrained by the fact that you simply *cannot get everything open.* They use an atheros wireless card (open-source drivers), they have hardware mic and webcam switches (great), they use coreboot (better than proprietary everything, but its not libreboot either), and they apply ME cleaner. What else can they really do? They can't wave a wand and pop up a completely open-source system because its literally impossible at this point. You'd have to get a core2duo laptop with libreboot and an atheros card to pull that off. My opinion is that they are better than buying some computer that makes no effort to be open, but worse than what you could probably accomplish by the right computer, a beaglebone, and a lot of work. If it were me, I'd prolly get a Thinkpad, wipe the ME, flash coreboot, and be done with it.We need open hardware *yesterday.* The fact is that at this point, you simply *must* run proprietary code to have a computer with modern hardware. That is not OK, is a recipe for being at the mercy of corporate (and governmental) belligerence, and is fundamentally a threat to a free society. 	
1440	 armoured_wankball	 I have an SSN and am not a US citizen. Also, why the fuck is a hotel worker going to check someone's SSN anyway? Do you want to live in a world where you have to show your papers to access and goods or services?	
1441	 RedwallAllratuRatbar	 I see no point, because you don't have google play services	
1442	 RarePepeAficionado	 &gt; Also, why the fuck is a hotel worker going to check someone's SSN anyway? You're trolling.	
1443	 pocketbandit	 Well, if privacy is something you care for, then Google Play Services is something you want to avoid at all costs.Not every app developer builds on Play Services, as that means becoming entirely at Google's mercy. However, most app developers nowadays exclusively distribute via Play since that means not having to maintain a download server and not having to explain users the scary "unknown sources" thing.	
1444	 Drdingidforester	 Ok just wanted to make sure.  Ive been reading up on it a lot and a lot of privacy/security enthusiasts list this as a positive, which made me kinda scratch my head.  Even the about of people who say masterpassword is a good idea - I like the concept, but once your master password is compormised - you are screwed.  At least I can lock down bitwarden with a password and two factor.  Idk i guess im old fashioned.  	
1445	 Drdingidforester	 Can you elaborate.  Is this is true this should be a pretty huge deal.  	
1446	 Kohr_Ah999	 Lastpass stores your encrypted password store in the cloud. However, it does not have access to your key, nor do they have a master key. Thus, even if they are compromised and someone gets your password store they won't be able to decrypt it, assuming that your pass phrase is suitably strong.	
1447	 traka11	 I'm not sure it's possible. A provider logs you 'cause it doesn't want to be accomplice when their customer freaked people of three-letter agencies  out.	
1448	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
1449	 quantum_dan	 You can use either email or phone number.  I just made an email-only account.	
1450	 lnplum	 If you want to be consistent you should use a separate 2FA/MFA app or dongle and most certainly use 2FA/MFA for the password manager itself. However for shared accounts this can get difficult to implement.Using your password manager as your OTP token source is better than not using 2FA at all but it's more vulnerable than using a separate Authenticator app (ideally on a separate device) because your password manager becomes the single point of failure.So think of it this way: if you would use an Authenticator app otherwise, you probably shouldn't use Bitwarden's OTP generator. If you wouldn't use an Authenticator app otherwise, it's an easy way to add 2FA/MFA to an account that would otherwise be less secure.

1455	 maxWinkler07	 The first option would be really like to have but we would never be sure if they actually did it, but if we start paying for services who are currently making money with our data, their business model would change and there may be less of a need to trade with our data, that is why we (at least I do) trust vpn providers which are NOT free of charge. 	
1456	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
1457	 sting_12345	 ok so again how is this better than apkpure or yalp?  I can get any of my apps I want, but play services framework is required for many useful apps people use everyday.  You can't just isolate yourself then you can't communicate with anymore and what's the point?  Just use microG with lineageOS and that is pretty much the best I think you can do right now.  It's sufficient to keep play services from accessing your phone all the time but allows you to use certain map apps or ones that need GCM.  I mean you can just do lineageOS and use signal, protonmail, GPG, threema, VPN, Orbot and wire all without play services but some of the other fun and useful stuff you can't use.  I just have an extra S3 LeEco with lineageOS and no google at all with the above apps for just communications and VPN.

1461	 Rafficer	 Pay for a VPN provider.	
1462	 TerryVow	 But a VPN provider can share my data	
1463	 Rafficer	 Your VPS provider can do that to. And additionally you are the only one using that VPN, so it's certain that whatever comes out of that server was you... Not really privacy oriented.

1466	 quantum_dan	 [Turtl](https://turtlapp.com/) and [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/)?  Both FOSS, both online sync with end-to-end encryption, both support self-hosting.

1468	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
1469	 quantum_dan	 The standard approach for that would be some variant of KeePass, which uses a local database file (see /u/capnmidnight's post).Another possibility is [MasterPassword](http://masterpasswordapp.com/), which generates passwords deterministically from your name, master password, and the site name, so you can generate them anywhere without needing to sync or store anything.I use MasterPassword and store them in an end-to-end encrypted note-taking app with password support myself (Turtl).	
1470	 e7zLnVMKqGdr8xfL	 &gt;  So all this effort has been for absolutely nothing, we are all living in houses with the front door not just unlocked but front door is completely removed. Not quite that bad, but it is bad. Wait for open source hardware with a trusted manufacturing chain, or a microcode update (that hopefully doesn't come with another backdoor).As far as all the effort being worth nothing, think of it like this... at least we are no longer slaves to Google, Facebook, and most data brokers. The path to privacy is a hard but important one.

If you can find a VPS which allows you to pay over Tor you might have a shot, but they're rare and don't last long.VPN -&gt; Tor -&gt; Internet is probably your best bet. It hides the fact your using Tor from your ISP, and hides your traffic from the VPN.

1534	 79cca0e8-d8ff-4ca9-9	 &gt; I'm a bit lost as to how to proceed. I might just have to buy multiple computers: a gaming computer, a compromised computer that accesses the internet, and an offline private computer. Does anyone have any suggestions?This is how people who are *really* serious about security handle things - different (non-interconnected) computers and networks for different purposes/trust levels. Yes, it's more expensive and a bigger pain in the ass than just running everything on one laptop. It's probably not worth the trouble if all of this security is meant to keep your mom/roommate out of your porn collection. It absolutely *is* worth the trouble if you're controlling millions of dollars (in the traditional banking system, or in cryptocurrency), privacy-sensitive information, or if the costs of a breach would be significant. Don't think of security as one big ON/OFF switch - think of it as a thousand little switches. Setting yourself up so that you're protected from 99 out of 100 threats is much better than being protected from 0 or 10 out of 100 threats. This doesn't mean you're invincible - it does mean that you're much less likely to be attacked as a target of convenience, and that unsophisticated/low-resource attackers may be unable to break your security. The goal is to make the cost of breaking your security exceed the value of whatever it is you're protecting, so attacking you, even successfully, is irrational.	
1535	 79cca0e8-d8ff-4ca9-9	 I haven't seen any good privacy-related info re SSD drives - other than knowing that from a practical point of view, they can't be "wiped" like traditional spinning media; and theoretically they can be configured so that everything written to disk is encrypted with a symmetric crypto key; so that destroying the key effectively makes the entire drive unintelligible. Unfortunately, while in theory there's no difference between theory and practice, in practice, there can be big differences. Samsung SSD's can be "wiped" by using their "Magician" software. I have no idea if that's forensically effective or just theater. If anyone's got specific info, I'm all ears.

1553	 AlpacaKid	 Great reply thanks!	
1554	 AlpacaKid	 I hear ya. Ideally I did want the US government to be included in the threat model, but I'm coming to see that with my circumstances it's probably not worthwhile to be go out of my way and spend money to protect against such. I'm way more concerned with more corporate entities like Google taking my information, so I'm thinking that should be more my focus.	
1555	 bearCatBird	 What is a realistic solution though? Network Effect at this point would be hard to overcome. 	
1556	 AlpacaKid	 I've done a bit of research into purism. Their initial products seems to have some quality issues, not sure if it's any better yet. Furthermore, it's got coreboot rather than libreboot, so I'm really not sure how private it actually is. And I honestly dislike their marketing approach, I find it to be a little deceiving with how they present their products.I'd be more interested I suppose if it had a decent graphics card so that I can game on it as well. Strikes me as too much money for what it does. For the money that they ask, I could buy a X200 Thinkpad and put Libreboot on it, which I imagine is fairly more secure than Coreboot with the atrocious intel's engine management (yes they removed parts of it's code but part's of it is still present and running; I'm not sure how risky, or safe this is). And I could buy a gaming system as well for about the same price.	
1557	 AlpacaKid	 I was quite excited and interested in things like Qubes_OS but yeah, the hardware that runs the operating system and all the security features is defective by design, there's backdoors that comes shipped with your computer that gives agencies the ability to control and access your data and transmit it over the internet, even when you've turned your computer off (assuming you're running Intel).Still, pretty neat operating system.

1561	 vivekkhera	 I do it for the convenience. I fully understand that it really does get rid of the “2” part by having it in the same place and treat it just as a rotating password. However, I consider the chance of anyone cracking into my 1Password is pretty low and would be along the lines of some state actor really wanting it. I don’t think some casual or otherwise targeted attack at me would give up my vault. 	
1562	 AlpacaKid	 Well it uses intel processor without even coreboot to disable the intel management engine, meaning that, from a security/privacy standpoint, it's defective by design and has major inbuilt backdoor vulnerabilities.

Well it's only two things (notifications/video popup) I have two adblockers on but the loading it's almost event blocking (can't hit back to get out of the site on first try)	
1568	 maxline388	 * You'll be carrying a laptop around just to install an app.	
1569	 TibetanBowlHealing	 Why does Roomba need a firmware update?	
1570	 no-two-know-too	 *I'm a bit lost as to how to proceed. I might just have to buy multiple computers: a gaming computer, a compromised computer that accesses the internet, and an offline private computer. Does anyone have any suggestions?*Yep.  Heres paranoid mode for you.  These instructions assume a laptop.  Keep your off-line computer in a safe, preferably inside a second safe (one inside the other).  Outer safe should be combo lock and inner safe a keyed lock.    Wrap the pc/laptop in a sheet of newspaper and then tape it up with a few strips of clear packing tape so that in order to get to it someone would have to destroy that wrapper and then replace it with the same sheet of newspaper (same paper and date) and they won't know what day or paper until they get through both of your safes. Of course remember the day of the paper you used and the headline. When you put the laptop in the interior safe, stick a piece of tape to the inside of the door of the safe and then across the complete length of the laptop.  It's hard to describe but think of it as pulling a cord or a zipper when the door is opened.  When someone opens the door the paper will get ripped, including when you open it, but you will know to listen for this sound as you open the door.   If you don't feel the tension on the door and hear that sound when  you open it, then it's been ripped already.  When you do open it, inspect it to make sure no additional tape has been added to try and cover up the fact it was ripped previously.    Once the laptop is locked into the interior safe, wrap the interior safe in a sheet of newspaper also, and then tape it up with clear packing tape.  You should have a method for this wrap that you can easily visually inspect whenever you open the outer safe so you can verify that it hasn't been tampered with.  For example, you could always make sure a certain common word is in the top right corner, or that the second word of a headline is on the bottom edge of the front face of the safe.  You get the idea.  You should open your exterior safe at least once a day for this inspection.To use the machine, burn a cd/dvd with whatever flavor you want of OS you want to use to boot, and remove the hard drive from PC.  Use a thumb-drive for your data (with encrypted FS) and then never leave that thumb drive unattended.  Ever.  It's in your pocket, or within arms reach when it isn't in your pocket.  Take it in the bathroom with you when you shower.  No one else can ever touch it.  Back it up every once in a while and then hide that backup somewhere really, really creative..thats a separate post.When you use the laptop, only use it in a known secure room. Preferably in a basement with bare cement walls and no windows and no above ground wall structure, and only a single light fixture.  Bring your own light bulb that you also keep in your safe.  It would also be good to have a cone of silence in this room, but that's optional.  Before taking out and using the laptop, visually inspect the room for any signs of tampering and optionally sweep for electronic devices.Now, screw in that light-bulb, take out that laptop, and then...take a moment to consider the absurdness of the lengths you have to go to to keep people from invading your privacy.  The point is, if you are going to any non-normative lengths to protect your privacy, then you are clearly guilty of something, even if you are not, and you are only going to draw more attention to yourself.  As someone else said *And if your threat model were to be the U.S. government, well, then you’re fucked.*I went down this same rabbit hole you find yourself in years ago and came to the same conclusion (magic lantern was an eye opener).  There is no such thing as a secure computer.  It doesn't exist.  At least not for an individual taking reasonable steps trying to stop prying eyes5.  If you haven't yet, google some of the exploits that are out there (intelligence agencies).  Most that are known are old...imagine the capabilities now.  Perhaps there really is a ghost in the machine.PS, if you get the paper delivered to your house, don't use that one, go to the store and buy a different out of town paper since in theory those would be more difficult for local operators to source quickly...but make sure you're not being tailed ;-)

1572	 Peachlemonpotato	 I agree, the good news is that the main source of government information on you apparently comes from programs like PRISM, which rely on your use of those large corporations. So by avoiding corporate tracking you’ve handicapped big brother substantially. Essentially unless you become a point target for them you’ll fly under the radar. 	
1573	 jayhawk7	 According to Apple’s security white paper:“The metadata of all files in the file system is encrypted with a random key, which is created when iOS is first installed or when the device is wiped by a user. The file system key is stored in Effaceable Storage. Since it’s stored on the device, this key isn’t used  to maintain the confidentiality of data; instead, **it’s designed to be quickly erased on demand (by the user with the “Erase all content and settings” option**, or by a user or administrator issuing a remote wipe command from a mobile device management server, Exchange ActiveSync, or iCloud). **Erasing the key in this manner renders  all files cryptographically inaccessible.**Regarding how iOS deletes these keys:“Securely erasing saved keys is just as important as generating them. It’s especially challenging to do so on flash storage, where wear-leveling might mean multiple copies of data need to be erased. To address this issue, iOS devices include a feature dedicated to secure data erasure called Effaceable Storage. This feature accesses the underlying storage technology (for example, NAND) to directly address and erase a small number   of blocks at a very low level.”

1586	 mclamb	 Rough floor layouts of all buildings are publicly available, I don't understand the privacy concern here.The goal is to attempt to add value to the product. Most apps that people download on their phone are 100 times more of a privacy concern that a Roomba mapping WiFi. The Roomba devices have an advantage that most smart electronics don't, in that they can move around a house on their own. In my opinion, seeing a WiFi map of my house is a really good idea. It would also be cool if there was a way to easily setup a Roomba to act as a temporary access point to extend the range of your WiFi network on-demand.

Targeted furniture ads.I'm sure they could devise statistical models to determine any number of significant life events - be that pregnancy or a death in the house...Also, the obvious answer is that companies exist to make money.  It absolutely could function without network connectivity, and doing so would save them money.  They probably make more by implementing it.

I don't know all the processes going on in my devices. Watch network traffic I guess. Hmm... maybe you could do that, do some sort of cancellation... or just unplug the wireless part of the board/wrap it in a Faraday cage.edit: It is kind of funny running adblockers for so long then you hear ads (mobile youtube app no adblocker enabled yet) and like holy crap, you see the ads related to your work/search related categories.privacy aside though, that is some cool tech, like orientation, comparing against dimensions, it's not like an == check between two strings.

1607	 dCLCp	 I agree. But here we are.

1626	 uoxuho	 It looks like Wikipedia's [answer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Entropy_as_a_measure_of_password_strength) is pretty decent, so I'll just point you to that instead of adding my own explanation that might be redundant.&gt; It is usual in the computer industry to specify password strength in terms of information entropy, measured in bits, a concept from information theory. Instead of the number of guesses needed to find the password with certainty, the base-2 logarithm of that number is given, which is the number of "entropy bits" in a password. A password with, say, 42 bits of strength calculated in this way would be as strong as a string of 42 bits chosen randomly, say by a fair coin toss. Put another way, a password with 42 bits of strength would require 2^42 (4,398,046,511,104) attempts to exhaust all possibilities during a brute force search. Thus, adding one bit of entropy to a password doubles the number of guesses required, which makes an attacker's task twice as difficult. On average, an attacker will have to try half of the possible passwords before finding the correct one.Though if you would like more information than that, feel free to ask!

1632	 TheBrainSlug	 It's a *publishing* platform. It's not being used for anything private. He is very happy to have everyone know what he tweets. He *wants* his usage of that service to be publicly available.  What exactly do you think the risks are here? There certainly might be some meta-data leakage associated with using twitter (or any website/web-service). Twitter also doubtless log what tweets you read etc., and that (unlike posts) *is* something that many people would consider "private" information. But I think it's safe to assume that Snowden is perfectly capable of logging in through the TOR browser, keeping posting and any more private reading of other's tweets properly separated, etc., if these kinds of things worry him.

1636	 Some1-Somewhere	 Never trust a drive manufacturer's claims about the effectiveness of their encryption or their wiping tools.If there's a chance that confidential/secret data might get saved to the drive, either a) never write it unencrypted to the drive - use a third party tool, and/or b) make sure the drive never leaves your hands with the dies intact.How paranoid you need to be depends on the data's secrecy and threat. If you're only really concerned with dragnet searches, just assume that the manufacturer's software might contain keyloggers (like so many others), and either don't install it, or clean it out really well once you use it to update the firmware.

1654	 substitute_user	 There is a Linux Distro called Qubes OS which is, I believe, worth to explore.From their website https://www.qubes-os.org/intro/ :"Qubes takes an approach called security by compartmentalization, which allows you to compartmentalize the various parts of your digital life into securely isolated compartments called qubes."Either way, I do suggest to keep Gaming on a separate computer if security and privacy is a primary concern (as it should).

1658	 skidmark-steve	 The only way to (mostly) erase an SSD is to either wipe the whole thing with random data, or use the ATA secure erase feature (if you believe the manufacturer implemented it correctly; some of them do NOT).Look up wear leveling. This is what stops you from overwriting files in place on an SSD. Wear leveling intentionally shifts writes around internally to prolong the life of the drive, to prevent one area that is frequently written to from going bad early. But yeah, to carry out data extraction like this, someone would need to open the thing, take out the NAND chips, and interface with them directly.There's also the problem of over-provisioning; there are usually gigabytes of flash in the SSD that you can't actually read and write to because they are there to speed up the SSD's internal operations such as garbage collection.

1705	 ImVeryOffended	 Yes.LibreOffice covers the office stuff.There are lots of private e-mail services.  Tutanota and Protonmail are a couple examples.Chrome - switch to Firefox (but be prepared to make some configuration changes and possibly add some hosts file entries to block telemetry and other BS Mozilla has been adding lately), or Waterfox/similar.Photos/drive - Get a cheap VPS and host your own storage setup.	
1706	 KopfKrieg	 Sounds like a bug to me. DAVdroid/OpenTasks had a permission problem that got fixed shortly, maybe try it again? And make sure, in system settings -&gt; apps, that you grant all permissions to both apps. This is important. If it still doesn't work maybe open an issue on the respective GitHub page.

1735	 Kohr_Ah999	 If you are using a weak master password for Lastpass, it is possible for an attacker to brute force it after they steal the encrypted store from Lastpass's systems (or a local copy from your computer for that matter). Frankly at that point the advice to change your password is moot.However, if you use a strong master password and two factor authentication (Google Authenticator etc.) you really shouldn't have to worry about your password store being in the cloud. The far bigger risk to your passwords is malware, especially man-in-the-browser attacks and keyloggers.

1761	 alphabetcereal	 If I were in your situation, I would save any pictures or text that you value into local files saved on your computer and then delete the account.

1762	 LatticeCrypted	 A little bit misleading, if you look at the previous bi-annual report you see that the percentages in which Amazon complies with the requests have somewhat stayed the same, it's more that the amount of requests from the government have gone up.

1797	 AnonymousAurele	 *”Across the country, private companies are deploying vehicles mounted with automated license plate readers (ALPRs) to drive up and down streets to document the travel patterns of everyday drivers. These systems take photos of every license plate they see, tag them with time and location, and upload them to a central database. These companies—who are essentially data brokers that scrape information from our vehicles—sell this information to lenders, insurance companies, and debt collectors. They also sell this information to law enforcement, including U.S. Department of Homeland security, which recently released [its updated policy](https://www.dhs.gov/publication/dhs-ice-pia-039-acquisition-and-use-license-plate-reader-data-commercial-service) for leveraging commercial ALPR data for immigration enforcement. “**”The Atlantic has called this collection of our license plates “an unprecedented threat to privacy.” This data, collected in aggregate, can reveal intimate details about our lives, including what doctors we visit, where we worship, where we take our kids to school, and where we sleep at night. Companies marketing this data claim that the technology can predict our movements and link us to our associates based on which vehicles are often parked next to each other. “**”To address this threat, EFF is a sponsor of [S.B. 712](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billCompareClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB712), a California bill introduced by Sen. Joel Anderson that would allow drivers to cover their license plates when lawfully parked. The legislation, which was filed in 2017, will receive a fresh vote by the California Senate Transportation and Housing Committee on Jan. 9. “**”In practical application, S.B. 712 would allow a patient to cover their plate when they park at a reproductive health clinic to keep that sensitive medical information private. It would allow a visitor at a mosque, church, or temple to cover their plate to protect their religious activities from being sold by data brokers.”**”EFF is joined by the ACLU in supporting this legislation. “*

1825	 AlpacaKid	 Are you sure about this? I thought they removed a number of the firmware blobs. They do use coreboot, is coreboot just as security/privacy friendly as regular boot?	
1826	 crespo_modesto	 What? Haha I wonder why it has a camera.	
1827	 MedianLethalDose	 I do have a lot more - I have a lot of experience in security.For now, another tip - turn on the firewall, not the one in Sys Preferences, the proper hidden one called PF (earlier IPFW.) A program called Murus is a nice GUI for setting it up. Icefloor is too, but for experts.HandOff! is little little snitch but also for outgoing connections and file writing, so if you REALLY want to be bugged for a while by alerts in the name of safety... worth it.

1829	 underdogmilitia	 TIL that reddit allowed a third party to incept emails of password resets.How did you think this would be safe?	
1830	 66C0UT7BZG8OEX8	 Tor Browser is a must for services like that if you don't want them to track you across the web, using things like cookies and browser fingerprint.Though personally I would never agree to their ToS, regardless.	
1831	 KRZ_759	 Of course, but Android without Gapps is a pretty decent compromise for the time being.

1833	 DurableNapkin	 Trusting a third-party vendor with password reset links, what could go wrong?&gt; At that point in time, we were able to determine that the root cause was due to a Mailgun employee’s account being compromised by an unauthorized user.2FA can't come soon enough. Also, bringing any **sensitive** account-related emails back in-house and using Mailgun solely for notification/marketing emails.

1846	 chesterjosiah	 Don't put a microphone in your living room that uploads everything you say to a corporation?	
1847	 lxskllr	 In general, you should do computing on your own computer when possible, rather than using "cloud" services. With "cloud" services, someone else has everything, and you have nothing. Some things like email are non trivial to setup, so an online provider might be reasonable, if not ideal. Office software? Image editing? That's easy to do on your machine, so that's where it should be done.  None of that is factoring what google is as a company, which is a spyware service. They don't give you fun toys cause they're cool guys. They make a lot a of money, and you probably aren't paying them...	
1848	 makeworld	 Yeah I know. It was a gift and I want to get some use out of it. I'm okay with it being there as long as it only uploads when I say the keyword.

1852	 h1ppie	 The general principle is that things you do in public are not expected to be private.  The problem is, that point of view comes from a time even there was no automated way to gather, store, search, and share that much information.

1857	 nokstar	 Reports have shown that even without the keyword, Alexa is listening and recording. It is true that initially the service doesn't upload anything until the keyword is said, however, the recording can be accessed and uploaded to AVS (Alexa Voice Service) at any later time.Alexa and Google are listening if you have this device. Keep in mind though, that your smartphone is listening and logging WAY more than a home assistant.

If Disroot doesn't work for you, checkout Nextcloud's [list of providers](https://nextcloud.com/providers/) for many other options.Another service worth checking out is [ox.io](https://freemail.ox.io/). 2 GBs of free cloud storage + 2 GB email quota, and services comparable to Google Docs. [Privacy policy](https://freemail.ox.io/data-protection/) is easy to understand too and worth a look:&gt; It is our aim to protect free communication through capturing as little customer data as possible, through technological measures such as consistent encryption to prevent surveillance, and through encouraging our customers to widely use the protective technologies available to them.

1864	 nitrohorse	 For added convenience with watching videos on HookTube, I've found an open-source [YouTube-&gt;HookTube redirect browser extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hooktube-redirect/) for Firefox that works well.	
1865	 debridezilla	 I don't see how that's misleading. The volume of data is still greater.	
1866	 PracticalPrivacy	 I've been a fan of OVH so far. I'm working on writing a series of articles about online privacy, and when I get to stuff that needs a VPS, that's the service I'll be referencing. From a privacy standpoint, it's pretty hard to know for sure what any of them will do, especially if they get hit with legal requests. Probably the best bet is to get one outside of your country of residence, and one in a country that has decent legal protections for privacy. Again, there's no sure thing, but that's at least another layer of confidence.	
1867	 66C0UT7BZG8OEX8	 No, that's not my area of expertise. Compatibility list is here however:https://download.lineageos.org/Though if you want a really good phone with even better (than Lineage) security and privacy focused OS, but one that's also both difficult to put hands on actually and expensive, then you can also take a look at Pixel from Copperhead OS.	
1868	 RutRow1	 So is it the Alexa data or the other data in AWS? 	
1869	 haedynne	 I agree it's important to get a VPN/S from a country that protects a user's privacy. Do you know where OVH is stationed? 	
1870	 PracticalPrivacy	 There's nothing wrong with using YouTube, so long as you know how to do it. One good approach is to always browse it in incognito/private mode, so that Google can't track anything about you (I tend to use Firefox, because I don't trust that Chrome isn't still reporting back to YouTube/Google somehow).	
1871	 WilsonFlips	 Amazon is a privacy nightmare in general. Best use of Amazon is:- Alias name on account.- Prepaid credit cards, or Privacy.com cards for payment.- Use Amazon lockers for product pickup. Do not ship to your home address.- Ditch account after a few orders, start over.	
1872	 nitrohorse	 Definitely [Standard Notes](https://standardnotes.org/). Awesome [privacy manifesto](https://standardnotes.org/privacy), open-source, cross-platform, and fast syncing.	
1873	 66C0UT7BZG8OEX8	 Your licence plate is not in public because you want it to be there, it's because if you don't put it there you're at risk of harassment and theft from government agents.	
1874	 PracticalPrivacy	 I believe they're based out of France, but they have servers in many different continents. Another good option is to use them, but get a server based outside of Europe. More layers of bureaucracy for interested parties to dig through. ;)	
1875	 PracticalPrivacy	 &gt; Chrome - switch to Firefox (but be prepared to make some configuration changes and possibly add some hosts file entries to block telemetry and other BS Mozilla has been adding lately), or Waterfox/similar.I'm starting a series about online privacy, and just wrote [an article advocating switching to Firefox](https://medium.com/@kellyrush/practical-privacy-firefox-browser-ad24169dc26c) over Chrome. I will say, it's hard to give up the magical nature of everything syncing between Google's services. One thing I've started looking into is how to set up your own Firefox account/sync server, but it's not exactly straightforward. If I figure out a good approach, I'll make that into an article as well.	
1876	 azerbajani	 Update: they rejected my account and disabled it.

1884	 ghani256	 That should have been an indication of what they are trying to do. Trying to build a database of the citizenry to sell to the Governments.	
1885	 Exaskryz	 &gt;that your smartphone is listening and logging WAY more than a home assistant. Reports from people doing wireshark and monitoring for files on the device suggest this isn't the case. (The only thing I haven't seen is people analyzing RAM to see if voice recordings are tucked into "Other").I'm all for the paranoia and I am ready to believe that phones do that, especially with apps like Facebook, but it doesn't seem they do.But maybe you're talking about the "OK Google" or "Hello Siri" features and they keep recording until they detect your voice?

1888	 iJeff	 But do they store the recordings like Google does?	
1889	 iJeff	 Android devices do record a ton of telemetry. Disabling them doesn't always work. They were reporting locating information even when the option was disabled.The OK Google command does also trigger false positives more often than never. You can check your own voice clips online to see. What's good about Google is, even though using their services is a giant privacy issue, they're *generally* pretty transparent about it. However, their business model inherently conflicts with real privacy. Not that is needs not to.

1894	 PracticalPrivacy	 I tend to sandbox things, as so:1. I use Firefox and DuckDuckGo for most of what I do.2. I use Chrome for Google/Amazon/Facebook only. That way they just keep sharing the same stupid information back and forth with each other.3. I use Facebook in Chrome in Incognito mode, just for good measure, because Facebook is the worst.

1902	 spacebandido	 Tl;dr I don’t think Alexa actually listens 24x7 and sends everything back to HQ.I read a post the other day which explained the technical details of how Alexa listens... on mobile so can’t/won’t link.The reason Alexa can’t hear everything (according to them) is because their listening mechanism is a two step process:* Alexa always listens for her wake work “Alexa” from a secondary processor.* once it hears the wake words, it activates the main processor which will actually start recording and actively listening/processing the input.So according to them, Alexa is technically incapable of listening 24x7. I would think that, if this isn’t the case, someone who has some networking chops would’ve been able to wireshark their network and find traffic coming from Alexa.... unless they’ve embedded a SIM card in the device and it’s talking over its own dedicated cellular channel (or some other dedicated line)... but I feel like this would also have been found in product tear downs.Also I feel like the risk of being caught doing this would be a massive PR killer. Wouldn’t make business sense.

1907	 aproposnix	 Yeah, it's crippling.  I'm not sure why no one has created a similar FOSS clipper. Bookmarking is simply not sufficient nor is just taking a screen-shot of a page.  We need a web clipper that will allow users to select whatever elements of a page (text, images, the entire page, pdf's, etc) they need with the page URL as part of the note (for references - useful for research work). Once we have that, a real EN replacement is possible. 	
1908	 As4fN1v	 I don't think you need an open source bios for this. The chances of getting hardware backdoors are very low.

That mode only deletes cookies per sessions, and there are also different means to track users these days. Also, you shouldn't be agreeing to Google or FB ToS if you value privacy I think.	
1923	 T5UV9UCI5Q5S3J9	 &gt; The information we collect may include: personal data, for example your name, email, IP-address, location; and non-personal technical data, for example who manufactured your device, your screen's resolution, your mobile operator's region and code.https://www.opera.com/privacyWhy would a web browser want to know my name? Jeeez,  stay away from this stuff.	
1924	 iJeff	 Mostly because it's also very expensive to gather and use. Unless they're running the same kind of machine learning operations as Google, it's both not worth it and a very different privacy concern. The standard practice is to use it for recognition and possible stored analysis, but not many go as far as to store the actual voice recording clip as Google does.

1943	 iJeff	 Web traffic and cloud client bases are a very different business. Amazon wants to sell services and products. Google sells products to bolster their free services.

1979	 dubski	 If you can't change the Google Wifi because you are not the owner you could put another router in between the Google Wifi and your devices.  This other router could be VPN enabled. So in effect you would be on a separate network.  Failing that, use VPN for Internet on all devices and encrypt all your local network traffic.	
1980	 makeworld	 It's not hardcoded, as you can change the keyword within a set list. Having Alexa always listen isn't impossible, as far as I know. 	
1981	 DeadSamurai	 I feel like this wouldn't make much of a difference, you can already request deletion of your personal data from Facebook via deleting your account (albeit with about a month wait) although I'm skeptical that they ever actually delete it anyway as there is no means of verification 	
1982	 JuSt__AnOtHeR__dUdE	 So there is no possibility that it can be activated remotely?	
1983	 Eidbi	 Then why do you use Chrome? There is no meaningful difference between Chromium and Chrome, in terms of usability. Any extension from Chrome works on Chromium as well. As it is actually the other way around. The extensions are developed for Chromium, not Chrome. They simply work on Chrome.You can download stable builds of Chromium for any OS here - https://chromium.woolyss.com/You can also use Opera, which is bad for privacy, but has its own extension store and supports Chrome/Chromium extensions as well.Other than that, there is also Vivaldi, which also supports Chrome extensions and is based on Chromium.Srware Iron also supports Chromium extensions.And so does Comodo Dragon.And if you don't need Chrome extensions, you may go for Iridium, Ungoogled Chromium, Inox, Epic and Brave, each of which are much better for privacy than Chrome. Brave supports extensions, but you have to install them manually - https://brave.com/loading-chrome-extensions-in-brave/	
1984	 cBvOh76Zo2i9	 Indeed. Facebook targeted *suicidal teenagers* and there was no outcry, indeed, no press attention at all.	
1985	 PracticalPrivacy	 &gt; Also, you shouldn't be agreeing to Google or FB ToS if you value privacy I think.Ideally, but they are so pervasive, not everyone has the luxury of opting out. If you have to use them, just make sure to do so intelligently.	
1986	 BrayWinsOrWeWyatt	 So you don't carry a smartphone either?	
1987	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Google Wifi routers maintain a connection to Google at all times. They claim they don't collect browsing data, but they do collect all sorts of other information about devices and such. IMO, you cannot trust Google and this means you need a VPN. A VPN moves trust from your computer to your VPN provider. VPN trust is difficult- they have shit for oversight but there is an incentive not to sell your data as there are many options and any word of them selling out their customers (even a rumor) can destroy their business model. Thatoneprivacysite is a good reference for VPNs, reviews of providers, etc.Browser security is more important than ever. Smaller browsers generally have less code, but they also generally have less code review and less protections built in. I know you hate Mozilla's shenanigans- we all do- but with a solid user.js to turn off extra crap and the right extensions, Firefox is still the best we have.If you want anonymity Torbrowser is a must. Whonix is even better. Use it for doing research, activism, and even general browsing when you feel like it. The more that use Tor the better- Tor isn't perfect but it raises the complexity of data-gathering and thus it raises the cost.	
1988	 BlueZarex	 It's also worth a reminder that these are just the number of requests and do not reflect the scope of each request. A Single NSL for instance, could be "Give us all the data, from every site, that mentions the word " Snowdon" or "Trump Resistance".

1991	 substitute_user	 In regards to Alexa, it is known that the 2016 models have been compromised. Attackers were able to upload a piece of code to Alexa that would allow to turn the microphone on or off and re-route recordings to a different IP address. It seems the 2017 models have been updated by Amazon. However, privacy concerns remain about networked devices that are able listening to conversations. 	
1992	 uoxuho	 It varies by application, and you should keep in mind that a strong password/passphrase is part of a greater strategy which should include being vigilant against malware, not reusing passwords on multiple services, not sharing accounts with friends, etc.As I mentioned in my original post, a numerical passcode on an iPhone has a laughably small amount of entropy by most traditional standards, but the phone itself has other security protections besides just the passcode.Similarly, a password/passphrase can be relatively weak on an online service which limits the number of login attempts. For example, if your email provider locks your account and requires multi-factor authentication after 3 incorrect guesses, then I would argue that 25 bits of entropy would be more than enough.The threat is very different if, for example, you are talking about encrypted data on a traditional desktop PC, in which case an adversary could copy the encrypted data and the passphrase-protected decryption key onto a supercomputer and attempt to brute-force the passphrase. In this case, where the passphrase is the only thing protecting the payload, the recommendation as of a couple years ago is 100 bits of entropy at the very least, for example using an 8-word diceware passphrase. Many cryptocurrency wallets now help you generate 12-word passphrases, which is potentially more than 150 bits assuming those programs use diceware-sized dictionaries.	
1993	 TheMoltenJack	 Enabling fingerprinting protection in Firefox solves this. On chrome you have to be root. Thanks for the tip	
1994	 Eidbi	 Why can't you change it? If you are serious about privacy, you should talk about possible problems, ranging from using it with an owner, if it doesn't belong to you.You should change it, if you want privacy.	
1995	 Methmo	 &gt; you can already request deletion of your personal data from Facebook via deleting your accountAll categories of data? Or just the ones you knowingly gave to them through your Facebook account (rather than all their tracking cookies and scripts on seemingly every website)?

1998	 Eidbi	 &gt;Browser security is more important than ever. Smaller browsers generally have less code, but they also generally have less code review and less protections built in. I know you hate Mozilla's shenanigans- we all do- but with a solid user.js to turn off extra crap and the right extensions, Firefox is still the best we have.With javascript being enabled every browser is compromised. There are Spectre and Meltdown, two critical vulnerabilities, affecting nearly every PC, laptop and phone device made in [last 20 years] (https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850516/intel-meltdown-spectre-bug-patch-cpu-security-flaw-news) It is not yet proven that Meltdown affects ARM and AMD CPU for certainty, but Spectre definitely does. Hence using any browser is not secure anymore with Javascript enabled. And these issues can't be fixed by any software updates, as they are hardcoded in a hardware, they can be only mitigated. So basically there is no fix, unless you buy a totally new hardware, which doesn't even exist yet.	
1999	 sophware	 I don't know if the tech is ready; but this makes me root for Storj and Sia. One of those is so secure/ private, there's a concern people could store CP without being detected. My thought is that this is a direct result of fishing expeditions and violations of privacy by governments. It's on them.

I simply use javascript on a first-party basis now for sites that I trust (eliminating third-parties because often the site doesnt even have control of their actions).Its not perfect, but I its about the best we can do without not using the internet.

2064	 happybeing	 MaidSafe are building something that no other crypto project is attempting, and if they succeed which now seems likely IMO, it will blow almost all of them away because it will exceed their features and capabilities without the limitations of blockchain such as not scaling, delays, transacting fees, weak anonymity, centralisation, censorship, and energy inefficiency.IMO it will do everything a blockchain can do but is massively scalable, faster and energy efficient. This is because it uses a 'close group concensus' of a few randomly assigned nodes which have earned trust to look after each chunk of data, rather than requiring every full node to hold and update an enormous database. So it isn't just a ledger, first it's a storage and communications network, on which you can build anything, including currency ledgers, secure anonymous storage, decentralised anonymous Internet etc. Privacy and security are built in from the bottom up. It uses proof of resource rather than proof of work, which is secure but also efficient, and is designed to allow ordinary commodity PCs, and even mobile devices to contribute resources in exchange for SafeCoin (a non-blockchain cryptocurrency, not an altcoin) which can be used to purchase storage and other services from the network. This currency will be true digital cash, anonymous, fast, high volume, and capable of micropayments. So ideal for commerce on the network, and suitable for IoT applications. No middlemen, this will be the world's first truly autonomous network.If any of that sounds impressive, it isn't even the whole story, here's a good intro if you want to read more: https://safenetforum.org/t/10-key-facts-about-safe-network/12948?u=happybeing

2079	 future_greybeard	 Not very helpful for the average person, but I've begun to send my business colleagues (I'm a sysadmin for a business) who are traveling overseas sterile devices to use for their trip. They're basically just used as dummy terminals, and a VPN connection allows them back to their work computer, where all of their data and necessary access is already set up for their day-to-day duties. We also allow these employees to connect to a second system for their personal use while traveling (unrestricted and on a guest vlan, basically. We nuke these machines after each use, and redeploy when requested), but they'll have to plan accordingly for personal phone and text messages during their trip.If they choose to bring personal devices with them, we're not responsible for the hardships they face, or any loss of data. We strongly recommend that they only use these sterile devices, and take the necessary precautions for all other devices. Assume all traffic not done via the VPN is being monitored, and that all devices will be searched by the various customs representatives as they travel.

2101	 bigbearandy	 Yep, we have IME software that we put on devices to keep them sterile. That's why notions like this seem ultimately stupid, worthless, security theater. They are greatly expanding a market for IME software specifically so that anything worth looking at never makes it on a mobile device. I'm sure user-friendly security software benefits terrorists as much as it does corporations in data security. It's not going to catch anyone who has something to hide, as the solution is to bring a burner phone with nothing on it. The only possible benefit to national security and the flying public is to promote complacency on one's own privacy rights so they can snoop where they want unfettered.I'd be pretty annoyed, as I'd have to relinquish my phone, as the requirements of HIPAA data security trump those of the government in this scenario, and by corporate policy, I cannot unlock my phone for anyone unless they've established a compelling need. A real LEO conducting an investigation is a compelling need, a TSA fishing expedition is not.

2108	 pastelbacteria	 DNScrypt is already redundant in the examples you've pointed out.When using a broadband connection the sites you visit are still leaked due to SNI implementation in HTTPS.When using a VPN or Tor, your configuration should always route DNS queries over them - this is enough to prevent leakage. DNCrypt's purpose wasn't really for obfuscation but rather validating DNS between client and server.

2151	 stemid85	 SNI in HTTPS leaks sites to the server you're visiting. At that point it's redundant to talk about leakage. It wouldn't leak to anyone listening at your ISP for example.A major issue for a lot of VPN users is leaking DNS queries. It's easy to say how the configuration should look but in reality it's not always perfect.Either way I've grown accustomed to having all my DNS queries encrypted. It looks like I'll have to switch my dnscrypt setup to unbound with dns tls instead. Looking at it now I'm surprised I didn't use this all along since I have a LAN resolver that could easily be unbound instead of dnsmasq. And I run my own upstream DNS that can use dns tls instead of dnscrypt-wrapper.It does seem as if dnscrypt is redundant. Still though I think the author was wrong in just deleting the repo like that. If they were bothered by issues they could have disabled Issues in the repo and left it forkable.	
2152	 causa-sui	 Damn, we posted this same idea minutes apart	
2153	 JavierTheNormal	 They search 0.07% of phones at the border. The new policy prohibits them from searching anything not actually on the phone (i.e. they disable data connection), and require reasonable cause for using search tools for an "advanced search."Look, I'm pretty into privacy and I will personally use countermeasures, but 0.07% is *tiny*. You surely have more important matters to worry about. And border guards in other countries can search you too, this isn't unique.The simplest solution is to encrypt your phone, turn it off, and refuse to unlock it. If they impound your phone for five days, oh well.

2157	 dark_volter	 There is a app called EDS which is supposed to do the same, and works with VC and TC volumes- I don't know if anyone around here has played with it yet.The issue though is this hits all devices- there's only plausible deniability software that we've named- not anything more really-there needs to be far more, otherwise if thye hold you device they can request and will get extensions, and can keep renewing the time they can hold your device while they "investigate" although after copying and cloning, fishing is all they can continue to do..Foreigners are the ones screwed who desperately need more legit plausible deniability stuff just for personal items- kinda shocked it's not more widely developed, what are people doing anytime they go to the other crazy countries that do this silliness? More difficult solutions like cloud shenanigans with encrypted 7zip/veracrypt stuff, do work, but ....that takes ensuring you can find access to the web, etc- 	
2158	 mcg72	 A better measure is one that sends an encrypted copy up to the cloud and wipes your phone before you get to the TSA and the restores it when you get through customs, destroying the cloud encrypted copy.	
2159	 PracticalPrivacy	 Eh. You can get Android devices for as little as $10. They obviously aren't great devices, but they do well enough to keep you running for a few days.	
2160	 alreadyburnt	 One of my favorite presentations of all time is about [Decentralized Surveillance](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=BcvxD7p4Suw)(don't forget youtube-dl). So here's that resource to inform the discussion.Edit: for the record, I think open surveillance is only marginally preferable to state surveillance, and I still don't support it. State surveillance needs to become something lawmakers are punished for being associated with. It should become a redline primary issue, "Support state mass surveillance and I will not vote for you under any circumstances, period." An even better solution would be to legally limit what kinds of information a government official is allowed to keep private, and punish for failing to conform to rigid transparency rules.

2168	 IntoTheBloodySky	 You're right, it's definitely not simple. But like you said everyone can learn.I think for a cultural shift like that to begin there would need to be big shift in the motivation of the public toward privacy and away from sharing more and more on social networking.	
2169	 ProudNortherner	 I still have my old phone now that ive thought about it, would a factory reset be sufficient?  	
2170	 PracticalPrivacy	 Sure. Give it a factory wipe, and then just sprinkle normal life crap on it.	
2171	 pastelbacteria	 If you're running your own upstream resolver then create a VPN tunnel from it to your router. You can now access unbound through the vpn interface on the router.This is what I've moved over to from the whole dnscrypt-server package. I'm using Wireguard VPN in the setup.https://www.wireguard.com/For those not running their own upstream resolver then the removal of DNScrypt-proxy is going affect them far more.	
2172	 roubent	 It’s now redirecting to dnsprivacy.org... seems like a poorly handled transition to me, as the new site is similar in nature.All in all DNScrypt should really part of the base DNS protocol rather than a kludgy hack. It’s only slightly better than stunnel if you ask me, in that at least it’s not persistent. Adding TLS to existing DNS protocol is the proper way to do it.

2174	 TrashMacNugget	 Tor should have an option to choose an exit node in a specific country, so choose UK, USA, Canada or Australia.Even if you do get signed up, you probably won't be able to cash out seeing as you don't live in any of the countries (and they probably wouldn't give you Euros even then).	
2175	 river_tree_nut	 Right on, thx. I think I get what you mean about authenticating system wide. I don't know much about the mechanics of that type of stuff.  When it does system-wide authentication, does that give it the ability to see everything that's in that system? Or is it a more limited protocol?

2189	 CanaznFTW	 There are a lot of comments about having alternative methods to secure your phone and then surrendering it to be searched. Am I the only one frustrated by the fact that you shouldn't have to have your device searched at all? I run stock Android so a second account can be easily made but the device shouldn't have to be searched in the first place.. 	
2190	 DedifferentiatedLick	 The power of centralization continues.... one day we’re going to wake up in a socialist/communist society and most people will have no idea how it happened.. 	
2191	 kayfsea	 Now as a follow-up Lineage OS and Copperhead OS come with some major trade offs. The only way Lineage OS is private in anyway is if you don't use google play services which rules out a lot of apps and Copperhead OS doesn't support Google Play Services so unless you want to make some major comprimises I'd say stick with the iPhone and just look at changing all of the privacy related settings such as ads personalization.	
2192	 snorkasaurus	 When I discovered the dnscrypt-proxy repo had been archived I updated my fork and [opened an issue](https://github.com/snorkasaurus/dnscrypt-proxy/issues/7) hoping to discuss the future of the project.  I tried to contact all dnscrypt-wrapper admins via the web sites listed in the public resolver list, but received little interest.  There has been some discussion today about the new events in the issue linked above.Feel free to join the conversation on github if you wish.	
2193	 bigbearandy	 Yeah, IME is also used in localization context. In this case it stands for "Integrated Mobile Environment," in other words a suite of tools for common business needs that are tightly integrated to the device's security, such that administrators can control the device down to the level of which applications can cut and paste into others.	
2194	 Pisodeuorrior	 Oh I understand, thanks. 	
2195	 TrashMacNugget	 The upside would be people would probably be outraged at how invasive that is, and want to get rid of surveillance all together. That, or they'll get used to it and we'll be worse off than we were before.	
2196	 snorkasaurus	 I am not sure about simplednscrypt, but the update script that comes with dnscrypt-proxy points to download.dnscrypt.org which is probably not working for many people now (though 8.8.8.8 seems to have it cached still).Update: no longer cached at 8.8.8.8.	
2197	 rya_nc	 If they take it out of your sight, you should probably replace it rather than simply restoring the backup.

2199	 practicalguy	 TBH I'm not all over substratum but from what I've read they have a good little project but you just can't compare with MaidSafe.And it's obviously a copy in some form.Imitation is the truest form of flattery after all. Technically speaking Maidsafe is a far superior and more secure anonymous full service. Sub is backed up on ETH no? Maidsafes safe network is it's own thing completely unique core is all in rust and apps in js.The way MS automatically authenticates anonymous users is pure genius IMHO, all encrypted up to five layers from memory... Built in redundancy, suite of tools, already existing browsers, websites and apps it's crazy.  Then the fact you have their farming method with no block chain ... Crazy good IMHO https://m.imgur.com/a/tCEvgAnd in regards to privacy and anonymity that's what MS is designed for. Sub seems to be focused primarily on decentralized servers if I'm not mistaken but as with most of the block chain tech we know it's not anonymous. Anyway my 2 cents. I wish them well. 	
2200	 FriesWith	 &gt;The USA happens to be the largest economy in the world.This is true as of 2016.. possibly 2017, but probably in the next few years, it will no longer be true.  The EU is very close to the US in GDP and China is growing at an even faster rate.  As evidenced here, the current administration has policies that are making doing business in America much less appealing.	
2201	 J0bon	 Exactly. If people followed rules, the entire airport security budget could be significantly lowered to whatever it costs to hang a few signs that say "no bombs or hijacking allowed."	
2202	 practicalguy	 Yeah I think the closest in terms of relative size of projects and benefits for humanity and technological advances you could probably say it's Bitcoin, Ethereum, IOTA and Maidsafes SAFE NETWORK... IMHO.

2204	 nitrohorse	 [Since iOS 9.3](https://support.apple.com/kb/dl1842?locale=en_US) you can "protect notes that contain your most personal data with Touch ID or a passcode." However I'm unsure of the robustness of the encryption nor any other details since the Notes app is closed-source. With Standard Notes all notes are [end-to-end encrypted by default](https://standardnotes.org/help/3/how-does-standard-notes-secure-my-notes).	
2205	 snorkasaurus	 The new site may be similar in subject matter, but is pretty clear that they think DNSCrypt is a dead end.  I [currently] find it hard to imagine that the acquisition of dnscrypt.org is not related to dnsprivacy.org's opposing solution to the problem of DNS privacy issues.

I'm wondering how they determine whether they think you're an EU citizen, and if it's more than just your IP address.	
2214	 practicalguy	 Yep decentralized storage, secure browsing, privacy, anonymity, crazy levels of encryption and autonomous authentication plus NON blockchain which is extraordinary considering their currency farming methods https://m.imgur.com/a/tCEvgAnd then you have their already operational suite of tools like clear net and SAFENET compatible browser, hosting manager,  email and chat apps,  authenticator tool,  dozens of sites and apps.

2218	 TrashMacNugget	 Faster, but not necessarily better; Tor offers better anonymity. If your oppressive government doesn't like something you do, they can usually go to your VPN provider and "ask" for logs.	
2219	 DeadSamurai	 That's a very good point, I can't see them just deleting all their data on deleted accounts so I guess IP address would be the most feasible way of going about it and although this can be manipulated I don't think it would happen in anywhere near enough numbers for it to cause them any concern, fingers crossed

I was going to do the Veracrypt full hidden OS option  ..which is the best option, but you aren't supposed to encrypt SSDs...and the worst part- when i got it half a year ago, nearly every other computer had only a SSD......I know most people here are not encrypting game computers with SSDs only, etc - but I feel like people are at risk of not being able to do this with the way a lot of stuff is sold as....&amp;nbsp;any tips? To my knowledge i'm screwed almost- except for the fact that hidden volumes are separate from the hidden OS technique, and am looking into those instead...Yes i know and am very well aware  the hidden os option probably adds a small gaming performance hit on anything, ....but they are more secure. If someone gets your computer and clones it, etc- the hidden os is the preferable option to hidden volumes from a security standpoint.&amp;nbsp;What can i do? Lol, dodged win 10, but can't encrypt my full OS cause the SSD still has that initial win 10 , plus you aren't supposed to encrypt SSDs and the like due to how they work, AND dual-boot config is also iffy for trying to do this.(if ARMA 3 ran on linux fully(apex protocol), I would not have had this silliness- but veracrypt's deniable plausibility/security is a little better than Linux's  anyway i hear...

2227	 parallaxbacon	 would you rather be detained and searched by lawless agents instead?	
2228	 AnonymousAurele	 I’m curious if this developer made an attempt to reach out to the InfoSec/Privacy community outlining the desire to drop the project, and if so why it wasn’t picked up.  If there was insufficient attempts made to pass along the project, I’m curious if there were pressure from unknown sources to dissolve the project.	
2229	 parallaxbacon	 searching even a single phone without a damn good reason is cause for alarm.&gt; The simplest solution is to encrypt your phone, turn it off, and refuse to unlock it. If they impound your phone for five days, oh well.congrats, now you've missed your flight and forfeited physical control of your device over to them. might as well just trash it right then and there.

2231	 bombadorz	 &gt;get rid of surveillance all togetherA beautiful dream, but to me a very difficult one to believe in.The spread and availability of cheap cameras and other sensory devices is only going to increase, as is connectivity between them. Same goes for meta-data, it's only going to keep building up and getting more intelligent. Even our culture (especially among the youth) is moving towards increased streaming of our personal lives and surroundings.These growing technologies cannot be stopped at this point, I'm afraid. We can only hope to guide them towards serving better ideals than those of the current states and corporations. I'm not saying which particular ideals would be better, but decentralization at least allows for a wider range of ideals to grow and be tested out.	
2232	 ackikokotos	 Isn’t this kind of missing the point? Im sure most people have nothing to hide. The government is going too far and it’s only getting worse. 	
2233	 [deleted]	 I implied no such thing. It doesn't matter how well they take care of equipmemt. If a company is willing to spend 10k plus to send them on intl travel their time is probably worth more than the occasional damaged/stolen laptop. If your comment was "Do not bring sensitive/valuable data across borders", I would generally agree with you.  Even then there are tons of exceptions.	
2234	 Drdingidforester	 This is why I didn't preorder. At least give me the option.

2236	 _-IDontReddit-_	 &gt; so i put an older windows on the HDD- (and modified it so i could use the drivers with a modern processes(kaby lake) but a older windows)Why? You should be using Linux for privacy. Microsoft has long since backported telemetry into Windows 8 and 7. Have one Windows for gaming and Linux for everything else.&gt; but you aren't supposed to encrypt SSDsWrong. You shouldn't use an SSD unencrypted, only to encrypt it later, since some of the old data can still be in the reserved spaces of the drive. And that's only the old data. The new data is secure. If the SSD is used encrypted from the start, there are zero issues.

2272	 dark_volter	 Gaming computer- so I have Win 8.1 on the HDD- ARMA 3 doesn't fully run on Linux(Apex Protocol), or else I would have actually done exactly that. And I knew I could seriously gut up 7 or 8.1, so i spent a long time configuring it as a exercise while being very careful not to backport that stuff in- including poring over tons of update lists, etc.. yes, it's overkill, for a gaming computer- -So, having this dual -boot config where Win 10 ton the SSD mostly unused really, you're saying i could go for the full hidden OS option without worrying too much about  hurting this?  I haven't really used the original Win 10 OS sitting there, and don't have anything saved on it, but didn't want to damage it.I also worried this would make backups difficult with this entire setup, of a dual-boot, going full-disk with a hidden os, then using macrium reflect to backup, and got differing answers when i asked around on reddit- I'd have thought i'm not the only one out to dodge 10, but also after trying to see what can be done from a security standpoint.(i'm sure they'd say buy multiple laptops....but that's throwing a bit more money than most are really up for tossing around...)

2276	 lethalmanhole	 &gt;"In this digital age, border searches of electronic devices are essential to enforcing the law at the U.S. border and to protecting the American people," CBP official John Wagner said in a statement.No it's not. Not when people can literally use VPNs and cloud storage options to hide whatever "evil plans" they have in such a way that it would be outside of the TSA's purview anyway.There's a big difference between trying to get a literal bomb through customs, and trying to get *plans* for a bomb through customs, plans that were probably already emailed to someone else, or in Dropbox, or OneDrive (I know those probably aren't privacy friendly, but that's not the point), or however else you can send data over the internet.So stupid.	
2277	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
2278	 vicegrip	 Should crossing a border give the TSA the right to enter your home and inspect absolutely everything in it, including your other computers? A phone has become an integral part of the home and people's lives.And it doesn't stop there.

2293	 parallaxbacon	 i wouldn't just leave it in their hands for so long where god knows who can interdict it as they please.just buy (or have your receiving branch prepare) a burner device once you get to your destination and pull any data you need off a private VPN or something.	
2294	 raging_coke_addict	 It probably wouldn't stop them. I'm certain their response would be something along the lines of "You can either surrender you phone for inspection, we can impound it for however many days and search it anyways, or you can just not get on your flight."	
2295	 parallaxbacon	 What? It's not about how well they take care of their equipment... it's about how well they take care to avoid disclosure of information.If a company is willing to spend $10k+ to send someone on international business they sure as fuck can spend a little extra to have a device prepared and ready to go at the destination to hand to their guy upon arrival.The alternative, and common practice of businesses today, is to bring blank or encrypted devices. But that's increasingly creating risk for the traveller because failure to decrypt or showing only a blank device can be used as an excuse to delay you. So does a company want to pay $xxx/hr or even $xxxx/hr+ to wait for their guy to get processed, deal with border shit, rearrange a new flight, and change his business schedule or would they rather just have an extra device on hand at the other end?It's a no brainer. There is nothing at all "unviable" about it *especially* for a business.	
2296	 parallaxbacon	 &gt; Now travel to the USA falls under this policytravel to *anywhere* should fall under "travel to hostile (aka foreign) country" because every country has significantly reduced protections of travellers anyway.

2308	 future_greybeard	 &gt;How does this work for travel to China where they don't allow VPNs?Not all are blocked, so we use one that isn't to connect to a hop box/bastion box, and then connect into the work machine from there. 	
2309	 [deleted]	 Couldn't you say you've forgotten your PIN? It's not like you can be compelled to remember it. That'd be the workaround here in Australia anyway.	
2310	 [deleted]	 That will only work in some situations so it's definitely not a no brainer.  You assume the business travel is planned well in advance and/or the business has a facility in the foreign location.  I've personally experienced just how bad shipping an item in advance can go wrong in multiple countries I've worked in.  This was with dedicated export compliance teams and expediters paid to deal with customs.  Even in cases where there is a facility overseas to keep assets at, nearly everyone is going to bring personal tablets/laptops/cell phones so they still have the same chance of being delayed at customs.  The cheaper and more effective answer is just to have a loaner pool of laptops with the companies standard image on an encrypted disk and then have them access as much as possible via VPN.  Tell them to decrypt if asked because there should be as little sensitive data on the drives as possible.  If someone travels a lot they can be permanently issued one of the encrypted laptops and a docking station as their primary computer and told to keep sensitive data that isn't necessary for the business trip off the drives.  Often times part of the reason a person is going overseas is to present, deliver, or install sensitive items that were just finished days or hours before they travel and are too time critical to be shipped and then held up in customs.   This is exactly how most defense contractors operate btw.	
2311	 mcg72	 why do you care if it's obvious you've wiped your phone?  They can search your device at the border, not your cloud accounts.

2315	 KyaniteArcher	 I mean we could try putting up a sign that says “stop doing illegal stuff”	
2316	 parallaxbacon	 that's just one example. depending on the particular needs, you can do many things on a gradient all the way ranging to bringing blank devices like they do now. you don't have to ship a device, in fact i wouldn't risk that. if you have a trusted host on the other hand, have them make the arrangements in advance. if you don't, buy a device once you get there and use it as a dumb terminal. maybe you need particular software or config preloaded, then it might be worth it to bring preconfigured devices with no data on them. In any case, a far cry from "not even a remotely viable option".	
2317	 theephie	 &gt;I still have my old phone now that ive thought about it, would a factory reset be sufficient?  Factory reset does not wipe the disk completely, I think. Encryption probably does.	
2318	 censorinus	 Last time I went overseas I put in a hard disk with linux installed, no bookmarks, etc. Took that over and used that. If customs had any ideas of seeing anything of value they would have been SOL.	
2319	 malmad	 I may be wrong, but doesn't the 4th amendment only apply to US citizens?

2321	 Shadowguyver_14	 Is it legal to do this? I thought we were protected under the Fourth Amendment from crap like this. I can certainly see you can sue your way out of it I would hope.

2329	 IceWobs	 With NASA it's half-half.. the first mistake I feel is confusion - national security is the somewhat shorter acronym NSA.But NASA does have top-secret documents, but of course not everyone has access or said documents on their devices. So it's possible, but not altogether likely.	
2330	 bo1024	 So do you advise them to consent to all searches?	
2331	 IceWobs	 The amount of communications your local senator does with businesses and organizations probably necessitates this.After all, they might have been trading some stocks before becoming a senator and then they have to get rid of it(?) once they are Senator and talking directly to these companies? Nah, not good for the money.	
2332	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
2333	 IceWobs	 Encrypt the phone, but this is the exact case that necessitates a Known Traveler Redress Number and maybe even a pre-registration in the Global Traveler's Programs that are offered by TSA.	
2334	 IceWobs	 Yeah... basically. At least you have the choice of a non-US corporation.	
2335	 bo1024	 Be aware of the legal implications. This could be possibly construed as lying to or misleading agents which is a pretty serious crime. See the [EFF's guide to border privacy](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017).Also, this technology does exist at least for laptops.

2338	 IceWobs	 Happens in most countries. A Japanese customs officer, upon one of my previous returns, did mention "oh hey, can I see that laptop" (it's a Chromebook -- rather rare in either US or Japan and I got stopped on both sides of the same trip).The Chromebook was inspected as a bomb in the US (full disclosure: I had opened the back panel and I think I had moved a wire out of its normal position.)In Japan, they looked at it. Said.. so what's the benefit of this -- you have some other computers? (Long battery life, good cheap computer for conferences.) and they said, alright have a good one. No turning it on, no showing its contents.It was a relief after the near-yelling match that happened in TSA. Mind you, I had bought the computer within a week before that at a Best Buy not 25 miles from the airport.	
2339	 bo1024	 Please read the EFF guide: https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017	
2340	 IceWobs	 Considerable idea, but not likely correct.	
2341	 IceWobs	 So if it looks like a phone, but has no SIM card, I can call it a tablet and be on my way? (Sarcasm, because I don't believe for a second I'd get off for this.)	
2342	 [deleted]	 Actually I said, "not even a remotely viable option for MANY business travelers."  I didn't say for ALL or even for most business travelers. Most would probably be accurate though.  Out of the hundreds of times I've traveled internationally there was only a couple trips I could have gone without hand carrying company equipment/data/phone/etc and still been efficient when I got there.  On many of the trips I did have company assets there in advance, but still had to carry additional gear.	
2343	 IceWobs	 I don't give our security officials much credit for keeping secret things secret. Not after all the leaks of the last five years.Not everyone, but still, I count the probability as existent.	
2344	 skrvd98	 I like your line of thinking.	
2345	 brent0935	 Wipe it and put a massive disfigured dick as your background

2347	 Drew4	 Many public servants are required to divest or hold investments at arms length via intermediaries before holding office.	
2348	 IceWobs	 Perhaps someone did record it. Look up anything you can find from SFO in September 4th, 2016 I think.Though we were already inside the protected area, so it's unlikely anyone would pull out their phone for a recording.	
2349	 morecupcakethanhuman	 Really? I'll look into those options for him. Thank you!	
2350	 IceWobs	 At arms length doesn't mean non-access.I find the practice border-line money laundering, but as a young guy unsure of his future, perhaps I'll be tempted to take advantage of work benefits someday in my future too, so I'll say little further.	
2351	 IceWobs	 The Redress Number thing especially sounds like the whole name confusion situation. Good luck.(I also have name confusion problems, but it's because I have multiple legal names in different parts of the world. Not quite as bad as any of them being terrorists or criminals, but I'm sure I get flagged for review even still.)	
2352	 Drew4	 Fair enough, lol.	
2353	 PracticalPrivacy	 Maybe, but I probably wouldn't risk it. Honestly, if it's a short trip, buy yourself a $20 burner Android phone; if it's a longer trip, do that, and then just mail your other phone to your destination.	
2354	 AhmedOfAmerica	 This recently happened to me, they went pretty deep into my chat history and even sent a text from my phone, a really violating experience.   It sucks because it makes you realize that all of the security features you thought you were clever for using ultimately don't matter when they can make you unlock it for them.I recommend doing a factory reset before you reach customs. Some other comments recommended profiles but from what I saw they seemed through enough that they would check for that.	
2355	 _--__--__--___-_____	 The trick is to make the user friendly to security, not the other way around. Unfortunately this usually requires users to experience first hand and directly the consequences of not being secure, but the more people see these things, they more they become friendly to the idea of some inconvenience.	
2356	 CanaznFTW	 I mean good question and I think you might be right but the article does state foreigners and US citizens we're searched. 	
2357	 _--__--__--___-_____	 The problem is they're doing this to US citizens as they return to the country.	
2358	 _--__--__--___-_____	 Considering that the suspected smell of marijuana constitutes probable cause to for an officer to search your car during a traffic stop, or having too much cash constitutes probable cause to confiscate and keep that cash, I'm sure you wiping it could reasonably construed as evidence of a potential crime within our current legal framework.	
2359	 parallaxbacon	 you can change people's attitudes to be receptive to privacy and security, of course, but that only takes you so far. human society is built on specialization, and computers are no different. you will simply never have all or even a majority of the population be highly proficient at modern computing even if they are receptive to the idea. so the experts need to make it accessible *and convenient* for people to use in their every day lives. otherwise you just end up with PGP.

My opinion is that this is 28K human beings losing their right to privacy and for nothing, since anyone who is up to anything can very easily back up data off the device and retrieve it after being searched. Not to mention the lack of a warrant to do such a search is very alarming.

Recent news actually improves things, now they need an actual reason to plug your phone in and siphon all the contents.You realize they aren't catching terrorists this way, they're catching people with text messages about their new job when they're coming in with a tourist visa. They're catching stupid people, and that's exactly their job.	
2385	 LuckyStrychnine	 Just remember cause and effect. In this scenario the cause may be from past incidents/threats that may or may not have been neutralized by a policy such as this. The effect now plays into more sinister means that we can only pretend are protecting us. Now any terrorist foreign or domestic is thinking steps ahead of this policy. Very simular to how innocent travelers are thinking in order to preserve their privacy. Only the rouge idiots would allow themselves to be caught in a stupid trap policy. This policy will not be effective in anyway.  	
2386	 onewheel991	 I question this too, or just have a passcode and say you forgot it. I would think a US citizen they would need a warrant to go through my files

2388	 CannoliForBreakfast	 What about this scenario:  Random Gov't police/border official will ask for all your passwords (from the articles and lawsuits, this does happen).  They will open your PC and log in, see the VPN app, ask for that login, then have access to your work computer from the 'dumb terminal.'   So could this be even worse?

2392	 Delta-9-	 As much as I want to like the idea, I feel like making it difficult for a computer illiterate border agent to quickly look through the first couple levels of the file tree is asking for the "advanced" search which no doubt involves doing a bit-for-bit copy of your entire hard drive. Might be better to move your private files to a partition that's not included in fstab so it doesn't automatically mount on boot, and leave a collection of innocuous files in /home for them to look at. Even better, put all your files on a thumbdrive and put the thumbdrive somewhere nasty. Okay that's not actually better. In fact, it's fucking shitty that we even have to talk about this. 	
2393	 onewheel991	 Didn’t the FBI lose its shit for like a week and we’re begging apple to unlock one device when some mysterious hacker eventually did it for them? I mean if I put a six pin code on my phone how much resources are they really gonna spend ?	
2394	 akingsley90	 If you really feel like making a private investigator’s life difficult in terms of finding out where you live and basic contact information, I would suggest that you request to opt-out of as many public data bases as possible. At inteltechniques.com, there is a section within the tools portion of the site for doing basic research on the databases in which you are in and take action as needed. However, if you live outside the U.S. this might not help. If so sorry for wasting your time.

2400	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I checked for privacy policies of every distro you mentioned and I didn't find any. I *did* find privacy policies for their forums and their websites, but thats quite different than the software itself collecting data. Are you sure you are referring to a privacy policy on the distro itself? Can you give us links please?The only instance I am aware of is way back in 2014 when Ubuntu sent off search terms in the Unity DE to Amazon so that ads could be served, and the community absolutely lost their mind over it. The backlash was so hard that many users- some of which were old guard having been around at its very beginning- *left Ubuntu permanently*. Canonical actually ended up switching the feature to default off a few releases later. I also seem to remember Linux Mint having ads on their forums, but I can't be sure- I've never used Linux Mint.Linux distros don't have telemetry, they don't collect and store user data, and they don't inject advertisements. There is a big reason for this: open-source code doesn't allow anyone a place to hide their monsters (greed, tracking, spying, etc) from those who they would set them loose upon (the users). Corruption is a weed that grows in darkness, and open-source code is like shining a sun lamp everywhere all the time- it doesn't allow corruption to take hold.In terms of your quote, I don't think it applies in this case. Consider the following example. You are walking and a $50 bill falls out of your pocket as you go to grab your keys. I see the $50, pick it up, chase you down, and give it back to you. Why did I do this? I exerted effort to help you... for free right? Not exactly. I exerted effort to get you back your $50 because my principles demanded I do so, and *because I feel good when I demonstrate integrity, and when I see someone else happy as a result of my actions.* This is similar to open-source. Some code is contributed by coders paid by corporations... but the code is open because of the GPL (and other open licenses) mandating openness (basically the same as the principles and integrity I mention above) in conjunction with filling a corporate need for a particular function. Some other code is contributed by Joe Blows like me who were driven to create something and who *derive pleasure from seeing it benefit others.*Linux is the result of the above. Corporate utilization of a free product subject to the restraints of open licensing for the purpose of filling a certain need, and individuals seeking to create and share code that fills a certain need. The Linux sphere today is also a massive hydra- it has many many heads (distros). This itself discourages corruption. When Microsoft, Apple, or Google slip some corrupt bullshit in your OS, what can you do? You can move to a competitor, but that requires you to completely change the way you work and often the software you use. As Microsoft demonstrated with Windows 10, in all likelihood you kick up a fuss and then take it anyways because they've got you by the privates. With Linux, you simply install another distribution (as in my Ubuntu example above); the Linux ecosystem is self-regulating, self-correcting (fork at will), and (almost) fully transparent. Its only trouble with transparency comes with corporate proprietary software and corporate proprietary drivers- and thats completely out of its hands.I think I understand why you are so skittish- you are used to getting fucked by the software you use. You are used to it tracking you, telling you how and when you can use it, hiding various things from you, preventing modification, etc. You are used to software being an adversary you must fight rather than an ally that works with you. I'm getting all philosophically heighty here, but you get the point I think. Try it out and I'm sure it will feel like a breath of fresh air.**EDIT** I should also note the difference between open source software (OSS) and free open source software (FOSS). OSS just means I can see the code- it doesn't mean I can do what I want in terms of modifying it. FOSS means that I can see the code, that I can modify that code and that I can redistribute that code as my own fork. FOSS is superior because I can take a program with a spying feature (or whatever), strip that spying feature, and then redistribute it as a new project- again this naturally helps regulate the software sphere to be one free of whatever we find odious (spying, etc). OSS is better than proprietary closed code released in binary form- I can see the code and can see for example the spying feature, but I cannot necessarily fork the code with my own modifications; with OSS the response would be to avoid the software to avoid the corruption (as opposed to having the power to eliminate the corruption with a fork as FOSS would allow).	
2401	 JackDostoevsky	 Is this not unconstitutional?	
2402	 bigfig	 I'd advise getting a totally clean phone rather than risk raising suspicions with encryption etc.  I have a backup phone in my go bag for use in case of natural disaster, and I take that with me when I travel, but otherwise it's not hooked up to my google account.  Red Pocket (redpocket.com) has a $10 per month plan, and you can upgrade the plan just for the trip. Edit: Strictly speaking *all* phones should be encrypted, but having sensitive files on a travel phone is adding more problems.

2407	 BurgerUSA	 You see, borders and customs are like no man's land. Specific law of a country may or may not apply in that particular area at that particular time. This is why there are duty free shops where you don't have to pay tax to any country to buy something so it's a lot cheaper. But the whole thing is rather technical and confusing and different countries have different rules regarding their jurisdictions.

2422	 BlueBugJuice	 That's fair about the privacy policy. I jumped to conclusions too quickly. I generally assume privacy policies for websites are generally tacked onto whatever other services companies also provide. They tend to read similarly. I was especially spooked because I couldn't find any privacy policy on the actual OS and just took their site privacy as the defacto. I also had just gotten done reading Apple's privacy policy and had it confirmed that they collect your searches. So I was out here all paranoid looking like the Mr. Krabs meme. Thanks for pulling me out of my own head.But here are the links I was reading just for clarity's sake,https://www.kali.org/privacy-policy/https://forum.manjaro.org/privacyhttps://forum.manjaro.org/toshttps://elementary.io/privacy-policyOpen-Source software would almost 100% let us know if our data was being collected then or funneled to some 3rd-party then, yes?I suppose the open-source would force "goodness." But the idea that groups of people would bleed and suffer and take so much time out of their day over code and share it with everyone......for potentially "nothing" except other people's privacy and maybe gratitude every once in a while? It's believable, human beings can be ridiculously kind sometimes. I've been on the receiving end of what I consider crazy generosity, but even so it's a mode that would be really difficult for me to trust if that were the only thing holding Linux up. It's not quite the case for it, which is at least enough for me to chill.	
2423	 JeffersonsSpirit	 &gt; A major issue for a lot of VPN users is leaking DNS queries.This is completely painless on Linux. UFW can be used to completely prevent this in about 2-3 minutes and requires almost no research. Editing IPtables rules directly would be more difficult, but it allows you to do more if you need it. Probably the only challenge with UFW is if you use libvirt- it injects its own iptables rules that will negate the leak protection in the case of a VM (downed VPN tunnel will see all packets from the host dropped as they should be but the VM will start communicating over the regular channel (ath0/eth0 or whatever)). The solution to this is to use systemd or your init choice to load iptables *after* libvirt is completely loaded.Anyways, there are a number of reasons to avoid use of a VPN (as well as a number of reasons you should), but dns leaks I don't think are one of them on Linux. Windows is terrible about dns leaks so I can understand there.

Between the external and internal firewalls, analyzing of every update, etc- you act like if anyone has windows on a machine they are done. Since we're using that logic, have YOU ever touched a windows box? looks like they have your number too buddy. Furthermore, I'm seeking to secure everything i have whenther it's more or less important, as practice, and so I can start helping others who have other types of machines, and could use the experience.Very few here will also go through the pain of setting up a Win 7 or 8.1 OS on a modern day processor and set the files so things from HD graphics to the other odd quirks intel disabled can still run... if they want to play games that are not yet supported in Linux.So I did all the hard work on that front, and now can help others in that regard- and so on.You might not realize this, but if one wants to become good- they enumerate, and practice securing every single device they can get their hands on if they want to poke around  and get a better grasp of their situation. But thanks for the nonexistent advice on trying to cover unique partition situations with Veracrypt. All the others reading this thread on how Customs is searching devices who could use that info are sure to benefit from that comment.I mean, it's not like people game or anything- and everyone is a infosec person  who doesn't need to take a newer laptop to somewhere, whenther it be for business, or anything It's about balancing requirements and securing what you do have when other options are limited due to circumstances.  Security is not impossible if you aren't rocking blackphones, tails and 3 burner laptops. 	
2428	 moderator_9999	 Well of course governments as a whole don't believe in privacy at the border, that's not in a governments interests, it's in the civilian interests. While this is a step in the right direction, it's still a step that shouldn't have been needed. For the land of the free, we sure are a relatively tame lot when our freedoms get taken away bit by bit. &gt; “In this digital age, border searches of electronic devices are essential to enforcing the law at the U.S. border and to protecting the American people,” CBP official John Wagner said in a statement.They are portaying this policy as being crucial to the "war on terror" and all that though. While catching and deporting individuals abusing tourist visas and the like, this is not the way to do it.

Not all of us do. Some might understand project A but have almost no idea wtf is going on in the code of project B, while for others the opposite might be true. Some of us might not be able to understand shit period. Could something slip by undetected for awhile? Sure. But with closed-code, something could be in there *forever without you ever being able to tell.* There are no perfect solutions, only shitty ones (FOSS), very shitty ones (OSS), and ultra-mega very very shitty ones (closed-source proprietary code) :)The thing is, if you know at any time that someone could look at and spot your nasty code, you are much less likely to bother when you can try to use closed-source as a vehicle for your asshattery... &gt; I suppose the open-source would force "goodness." But the idea that groups of people would bleed and suffer and take so much time out of their day over code and share it with everyone......for potentially "nothing" except other people's privacy and maybe gratitude every once in a while? It's believable, human beings can be ridiculously kind sometimes. I've been on the receiving end of what I consider crazy generosity, but even so it's a mode that would be really difficult for me to trust if that were the only thing holding Linux up. It's not quite the case for it, which is at least enough for me to chill.I do genuinely believe that is part of it. I've talked to many of these devs, and participated in a few projects myself. Do I think its always the case? No.For some open-source is free bug-testing, and a free way to get tons of good ideas and good contributions from others. With a closed-code product it has to stand on its own- if it isn't immediately useful, its not going to be used. With open-code there is more potential for growth because the process is more open to outside mental investment. This is why for example many corporations use open-source- they know it provides them with a lot for little money.I think its important too not to underestimate the human need for social relevance and social involvement. FOSS is a collaborative experience, and for many this gives them a sense of belonging, purpose, and the feeling that they are appreciated. Consider that Facebook has become one of the biggest corporations in the world by *exploiting the human need for social inclusion/relevance/potency.* Consider MMORPGs- the social component is the biggest draw to the games. In the case of FOSS, the social component still exists, but its realized in a different way. Consider: do I go home and watch TV where I am a passenger of whatever some show drives me through, or do I *sit down and write some software where I interact with people, create things they use to live their computing lives, etc?* The latter is a person with more power in the human sphere, and power (even the benevolent kind) is something that humans often desire. I don't think there is one universal motivation for every software project in the FOSS realm- instead there are many. Still, FOSS provides a solid regulation component that generally weeds out those whose motivations would be nefarious. Corporate products however do exactly the opposite: there is incentive to nefariously exploit your users while hiding it (profit), and there is actually a place to hide this exploitation (in the closed-code).

I could be wrong. Are the phones the same make/model by chance? I once had a computer that for some reason would consistently crash a router I had- another of the same model did the same thing (work computers all same make/model). No other computers/devices crashed this router. Once I flashed the router with dd-wrt the problem stopped completely.I will say though- for as long as I can resist I won't have a newer car. Vehicle health report sent over phone? Yeah no way in hell. Who knows what else they can send at will, what backdoors they have, what data they collect, what data they will suddenly be collecting with a policy change in the future, or what horrible vulnerabilities lie in the underlying code...

2444	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Its going to have to be calamity that brings such a shift. We are so far removed from the 4th amendment with this crap than *any* thought or concern by the public on this matter *should* have them up in arms.The 4th amendment is clear- the government can't look through your papers, house, etc without a warrant issued by a court. This asking people to unlock their phones is in very poor taste, but so long as we can say "no" and not pay a price, its tolerable and arguably still honoring the 4th amendment.But impounding a phone for 5 days? That is coercion. That is a clear effort by a governmental agency to coerce americans to forfeit the power of the 4th amendment to avoid the social penalty of losing their main communication device. It is a complete demonstration- without any room for argument- that our government is corrupt and does not give a single fuck about our rights. The only thing they care about is not pushing far enough to cause a significant wide-spreading backlash.As another poster above mentioned, ANY terrorist or evil-doer is going to use a burner phone or some other means to avoid what this crap purports to do. I try to understand government's actions as either incompetence or security theater, but I have to admit more and more I'm entertaining conspiratorial notions of there being some hidden plot to make the People feel subdued, apathetic, meek, and ultimately toothless for some reason.

2457	 lilikiwi	 Last week we were filling out the form for ESTA, and they've been adding questions. One of them was your social media account info. Seriously? That one was optional, but why even ask. There are other new questions, that aren't optional, that I don't see why they would need to know (parent's names, past and current employers,...). Seems a bit invasive for just a 2h layover stop...	
2458	 amunak	 Those are all terrible ideas. Just don't bring any data with you and don't lie to the fucking agents.If you need to bring data, encrypt it, and if they ask for the key be prepared to refuse it and bear the consequences (likely longer detention and having your device taken for up to several months). Or, if you are not a citizen, you can be just denied entry.So yeah, bring just  clean devices and download data once you're in. And read the [EFF's guidelines on travel to the US](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017).

2460	 zebbleganubi	 im no expert on the matter but ive used https://eraser.heidi.ie/ a few times.  i couldnt say for sure whether it wipes everything or not	
2461	 theephie	 &gt;I don't *think* encrypting overwrites the whole disk (including unused, and even over-provisioned, space), which is what would be needed for that to work. I'd *think* it does overwrite at least the whole block device, but could not find out by some searching 😓 If it didn't, it would be a big security issue.Debian installer for example wipes the whole underlying partition by default when setting up a LUKS container.Last time I had to empty an (encrypted) android phone I used Termux to `shred` important files, wrote the disk full of zeros, removed accounts and then did factory reset.I don't know whether device wear leveling allows for data leakage though...	
2462	 Eidbi	 Yes, but using YouTube directly has much more tracking scripts, collects your IP and any type of data entered there is sent directly to Google.	
2463	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
2464	 Eidbi	 No, they don't redirect traffic, it is just that they offer the ability to visit YouTube site without much of it tracking. The point is in extension, it is open-source and it changes every link on YouTube to Hooktube, and hence if you visit YouTube, you are sent to HookTube instead, which does lack much of YouTube tracking.	
2465	 amunak	 IIRC they can't really do that. I mean they can ask, but they can't really order you to do that unless they have probable cause.You can also just truthfully say that you don't know if you can do that, and that they should call your employer and ask them.Or you could just *not know the passwords* (at least to the VPN) and ask your employer for it once behind the border, that makes you even more safe.Anyway, please read the [EFF's guidelines on travel to US](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017) before traveling there.	
2466	 Eidbi	 The point of my thread was to point to an extension. It redirects all links from Youtube to Hooktube. And it is open-source. By visiting YouTube, you send all your data to Google and they fingerprint and track you from various amount of scripts. But by using Hooktube, you evade most of it. It is not a perfect or even good solution to avoid YouTube, it is simply (the only at the time) way to have more privacy while watching YouTube videos in the browser, without visiting YouTube directly.	
2467	 amunak	 &gt; a second account can be easily madeThis is a really stupid idea anyway, since during the questioning you could be forced to either reveal it if they ask about it (which makes you look really suspicious unless you tell them about it immediately, negating any effect) or you'd lie to them, which is (IIRC) a criminal offense. Of course they may not ask, but are you willing to risk it? What if they ask you to give them all your data carriers and tell them what they will find there or somesuch?Please read the [EFF's guidelines on travel to US](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017) before traveling there.	
2468	 Eidbi	 Yes. And when you do, the privacy is already lost.	
2469	 dominikh	 https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy	
2470	 Eidbi	 Refer to this extension for Firefox - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/hooktube-redirect/https://github.com/metiis/hooktube-redirectWith it you will never visit YouTube again. Instead you will get sent to Hooktube. It is the only way to access YouTube without much of it spying in the browser. The extension is also open-source, so it (the extension) doesn't track you.	
2471	 amunak	 &gt; If that folder is actually 3 folders depending on the password, and you use all 3, are you hiding anything?Encrypted folders probably already make you more suspicious. So they'll most likely take a full copy of your drive(s) (or they'll just take the device) and keep it for months, giving it to whatever agency in hopes to make some forensic analysis or decryption.Are you sure that your encryption is so bulletproof that they won't find out about the hidden volumes? And even then, are you willing to part with the device? You are not very likely to see it ever again.Why not just have a blank device and download everything when you arrive at the destination? And if it's too much data, why not just ship encrypted drives?If you do hide anything like this and they find out you are in big trouble. And if you have suspicious stuff like encrypted folders and such, they may just deny you entry if you are not a citizen. Is that really worth it?Please read the [EFF's guidelines on travel to US](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017) before traveling there.	
2472	 amunak	 If it's true it's fine. If you are lying to them and they somehow find out you are in big trouble.And if they deny you entry anyway you are SOL.	
2473	 amunak	 He didn't resist very much. He could've just repeatedly said that the phone is their employer's, they should contact them because he can't give away the data.In some cases you would be held liable if you do that (lawyers, people under HIPAA) so they have to expect that people will do that and act accordingly.	
2474	 amunak	 If you are a citizen you have it way easier, they can't actually deny you entry.	
2475	 amunak	 The CBP would need a probable cause, most likely (unless you give the passwords/keys willingly, in which case you may be held liable under HIPAA).	
2476	 amunak	 Read the [EFF's guidelines on travel to US](https://www.eff.org/wp/digital-privacy-us-border-2017) before doing that.

2479	 Eidbi	 But I don't recommend to watch YouTube in a browser anyway. You can't rewind video without lagging, it hogs CPU way too much. If you want to watch YouTube, try to use [Kaku] (http://kaku.rocks/) It is an open-source program, available for Windows, Linux and MacOS.	
2480	 Nalapl3	 Bad news, however at least we still can use it, since it doesn't have any auto-update mechanism afaik, and it doesn't seem to be vulnerable in any way. Worse news, with the project being dropped, is that some servers might drop DNSCrypt support.

2483	 Eidbi	 You shouldn't buy any phones, if you want privacy. Phones are **complete** opposite of privacy.You can't expect privacy from a **phone**, as it is **used** to connect with other people and chat with them. And to do that, your location is constantly tracked by your phone carrier. When you call someone, cell site, or transmission tower connects your phone through a cellurar network to another phone. Radio waves are used to do this. Your phone is constantly tracked this way. And you have **zero** privacy with a device, which has an ability to call someone.Why do you need a phone in 2018 anyway?You can chat through Signal, Wire, etc.Majority of people chat through Facebook, Twitter, Whatsapp, Viber. You don't need to have a **phone** to do any of this. All you need is a device, based on Android with Wifi available. **Device**.Why do you need a phone? If you want privacy or security, you should **never** buy a phone.

2487	 YorkshireGnarly	 Question whether your data, and maybe many of your apps actually needs to be *physically* on your device.

This is all beautifully authoritarian capitalism, brought you to by self-interest and a sleek profit-maximizing ideology.Do you think TSA agents would be looking through people's electronics if they weren't paid to look for shit they probably won't even recognize? Everyone pretty much agrees that the TSA is a joke of security professionals. Yet...there they are...being paid...to harass people for no particular other than they're being paid to do it. Capital makes that possible. And a capitalist obviously has an incentive to keep this charade of a security apparatus going 'cause it makes him or her money.It really irks me that people think socialism and communism are the only authoritarian political ideologies. Lol. No. This fake ass liberalism and it's economic ideology, capitalism, are the bane of the existence of *so many* people *because of* the authority of capital and the liberal legal system. 	
2503	 kazacy	 Excerpt from article:  “Always connected personal computers” — or ACPCs — refer to a new breed of Windows laptops with three key features: a battery that can last multiple days; instant-on access when you open the lid or touch a key; and an optional high-speed cellular connection, to avoid hunting for a Wi-Fi hotspot to get online.In other words, your laptop is going to behave a lot more like your smartphone.  “Like your smartphone, even when the screen is off, it’s still connected, so when I open the lid, it does facial recognition, and I’m in.”	
2504	 Eidbi	 If you trust your "content" to a large corporation, which tracks your and your viewers every move and makes business on gaining your information to show you ads, consistently removes videos and channels, which it or other people don't like, leaving followers of your channel or any other people who like your videos with nothing, then you don't deserve any views.

2510	 yayo-k	 You could try creating a fake DoD "courier card" that allows you to transport classified material, then make a red classified sticker to put on the device.  That should stop them completely if it seems legit.Not sure what laws that breaks since you don't really have classified material.  Just a fun idea, not recommended.

2514	 lannisterstark	 People still retain their own state identities in the United States. Louisiana is not the same as Tennessee or California or new Hampshire or the dakotas.The political system could remain similar where countries are states instead in name. 	
2515	 ctesibius	 No-one but an American would use a phrase like "capital of the free world" - the free world does not have a capital, and even it if did, that would not be relevant to business.In practice, business travel has become less important over the past fifteen years. I used to travel constantly for business, but reduced it greatly over that period due to improving VC and increasing pressure to reduce travel budgets. In the business I was in during that period (mobile telecoms networks and overlay products), the US was never a leader. I did have some suppliers and partners over there, including parts of IBM and Boeing, but it was not difficult to arrange things to avoid having to travel to the US, and I phased out travel there once fingerprinting of visitors was introduced. I am still willing to do business with US companies, but obviously security is a consideration - not just for travel, but security of data in storage in the US, risk of state-sponsored spyware etc. In practice, it has been a while since I've  had a US company as a supplier.

2534	 lfod14	 That's what I'm thinking, historically that's not something they've been able to to, you either had to go in for the update or download it from the sync website and load it with USB. The phone portion of the system does have access to phone history (controllable) but can't see how that would do anything as it's claiming the phone is off the hook when it's not.	
2535	 Y783ZO22MDBQ9S2	 Damn, this reads like a horror story.Though there is no privacy on Windows anyway:https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Computer_Security_Education#Windows_Hosts	
2536	 lfod14	 &gt; Are the phones the same make/model by chance?Nope, different phones, different android versions and mines rooted and doesn't take auto updates so that rules out something pushed to the phones that could have caused the screwup with sync.	
2537	 tylercoder	 I seen people do that but the results were a bit subpar 	
2538	 kayfsea	 While yes it is closed source, it is still held in high esteem by many security researchers. Apple has published many whitepapers detailing the security of the iPhone and there are still ways to test the security of a closed source device.

2539	 frenchmontanatheman	 I understand where you're coming from, however, I believe that if our fellow privacy aware redditors are going to make use of privacy benefits certain software provides, it also has to be usable for them on day to day basis. You shouldn't skip those aspects entirely.

A lot of the cheaper models are locked to a certain network, or only work on CDMA networks. You'll want to buy a phone that works on GSM networks so you can bring your own SIM, and if it's not unlocked, you'll want to see if you can unlock it either through the carrier, or by purchasing an unlock code for $5-10 on ebay.**EDIT**Another option is ebay. Here's a Moto E 2nd gen for $24 with free shipping. That's a totally reasonable phone that can get you through a week or so of usage.https://www.ebay.com/itm/Motorola-Moto-E-2nd-Gen-XT1527-Consumer-Cellular-4G-LTE/302584295360?hash=item46736defc0:g:UuUAAOSwvihY-kWN

2553	 alligatorterror	 Our systems have sensitive data on them.  We don't take a chance of an employee having their laptop with them that can house sensitive data.So we get the laptop they use for work.  Connect it, show them how to remote to it from the clean/burner laptop and good to go.  They can't copy over the file remotely from RDP along with thst.. the clean laptop has been disabled on screenshot programs.   So anything can happen to that laptop. It be safeWe also give sterilized iPhones.  No email allowed... only data, calls, text. In case anything happens.   Text msgs are read, so if anything related to data is transferred, phone is instantly wiped where ever it is.  Message is sent before and after wipe stating why it was wiped.All the fun of data protection!	
2554	 AhmedOfAmerica	 They sent "Hamas" to a group chat.

2565	 amunak	 They do for some things, actually. They may lie to you and tell you they don't to persuade you to give it to them "with consent" but some laws actually do apply to them.Read the EFF's  guidelines, it's outlined nicely there.	
2566	 nubsych	 This should be sooo fucking illegal.	
2567	 Eidbi	 They shouldn't. But will Dell you never know.	
2568	 amunak	 These are not your only options though. The best thing you can do is just bring a wiped or "burner" phone with no data on it. Then it doesn't matter if you give them access or not (though I'd still encrypt it, have it offline before going through the check and if they asked for access I'd give it only under order and protest it).Then it also doesn't *really* matter if they keep it; they shouldn't, but if they do it's just an empty, cheap phone.If you for whatever reason have a phone with data valuable to you, then you should back it up in case it gets impounded (or even stolen or lost, that just happens on international travels) and then if it's not incriminating data or whatever and you don't care about protesting this kind of stuff your best bet is probably to give up the password (at least if you are not a US citizen).

What I meant by "they'll still complain about capitalism" is that socialists tend to attribute everything bad to capitalism even if those bad things are inherently socialist. You'll probably be shovelling gravel in the gulags long before you finally admit capitalism is 100% the way to go.

I see no reason to believe that for-profit organizations don't consider DNS as a mostly untapped metric and meta-source by which to measure Internet users.DNS-over-TLS also does not mitigate SNI information disclosure.  DNS-over-TLS is not any easier for end users to deploy.  DNS-over-TLS is (as you say) backed mostly by for-profit organizations or individuals.There are people who have a use for DNSCrypt, who wish to use it, and who are looking for continuation of the project.  To come to this thread and suggest that DNSCrypt is a dead end and that users should dump it in favour of DNS-over-TLS is trolling at best, and at worst it is bullshit being spread by people who have an interest (financial or otherwise) in DNS-over-TLS.  If people want to use DNSCrypt maybe you should let them.	
2577	 amunak	 Indeed, but there are still some limitations. The EFF argues that while inspecting a device (for, say, explosives) is fine, asking for the password(s) and going deeply through all contents constitutes a "non-regular" search and is not exempt from warrants and such.	
2578	 Eidbi	 I think it can certainly track you even through use of Hooktube. But with limitations.Hooktube states:&gt;Share YouTube videos without giving them views. Bypass country blocks and age restrictionsWhich means that whatever script accounts for you viewing a video in YouTube is disabled. Bypassing country blocks also accounts for either some use of proxy or blocking scripts which check from what country you are and block you access to video. But we certainly need more information.

He put solar panels up on the White House.  But he was drummed out of office by the Republicans and all his policies reversed, much like Trump is doing to Obama.   Then in 1980, Ronald Reagan got in office and ripped the solar panels off the white house and doubled-down on fossil fuels, cut taxes for the rich, destroyed unions and presided over the biggest redistribution of wealth in the history of the country.Which brings us to where we are now: no middle class, monopolistic corporations that control government, and an extremely divisive populace that feels frustrated and helpless.  Since the 70s and 80s, America has lost 80% of its manufacturing base.  And we're still dependent upon fossil fuels which have the added negative benefit of potentially making the planet un-inhabitable within a few lifetimes.What "back" did the USA come back to in the 70s and 80s?   Oligarchs?

No telemetry gets installed that I can detect since all the extraneous junk is removed before installation.  Credit to user JRave."I do this in a similar but different way, since I need the control panel and a couple other drivers.Unzip the entire archive into a folder. Once you enter the folder you can now delete unneeded subfolders.Keep the following folders/files and delete the rest.* Display.Driver Folder* HDAudio Folder (Can Delete if not needed)* NVI2 Folder (A part of the Installer)* Physx Folder (Can Delete if not needed)* EULA.txt* ListDevices.txt* setup.cfg* setup.exeAfter you remove the other stuff and have just the above left, you can double click the setup.exe and it will run the Nvidia Installer and -only- install the above drivers. (Display, HDAudio, and Physx) It cuts out the extra bloat they keep adding while still allowing you to uninstall the drivers from add/remove programs. It also includes the Nvidia Control Panel. I also just noticed it installed Vulkan Run Time Libraries as well, which seems to be baked into the display driver completely.The only downside to this, is if Nvidia changes their installer layout."	
2629	 bruke53	 If you are a US citizen, this is 100% unconstitutional. It violates your 4th amendment right against unlawful search and seizure. If they want to look at your data, they need a warrant. Any time law enforcement needs data from a company, they need to have some sort of court documentation, they aren't just allowed to say give us your password and expect compliance. Compelled decryption or surrender of passwords violates your fifth amendment right as well. You have a right not to incriminate yourself. Not that the data on your device could incriminate you, but it is unknown by the law enforcement that your data could incriminate you, therefore making it have potential. Plus, even if you don't give them passwords, if you are a lawful US citizen, the only reason they couldn't allow you into the country is if they couldn't verify your identity, and that does not require your device data. You have a passport; that is its purpose. Barring your entry as a US citizen is otherwise illegal.

2631	 Eidbi	 I have a different experience. I had 5 YouTube channels wiped completely with all my data. Several of them were deleted along with my google accounts, including Gmail. On my last account I even had a video which had more than one million views. It was a shitty video, which I spent 2 hours (maybe 3) making, and I had much better videos there. But apparently majority didn't care about quality of my videos... Well, whatever. The point is now all my videos are wiped. I was smart enough (after 3 of my accounts were wiped) to have backups for my videos. But I don't have any for my first 3 accounts. All those videos were forever lost. And people who liked them (including myself) can't get to watch them anymore. All because I trusted YouTube. I can reupload the videos from my latest two accounts, but frankly I don't want to. What is the point? YouTube will simply delete them again. And hence my viewers have no ability to watch my videos again. They lost them as well. Also all the comments, all discussions I had with people were completely wiped.I will wait for a good privacy-respecting alternative, until I upload my videos. Now I don't have any desire to upload anything to YouTube ever again.

2638	 Eidbi	 You don't have any privacy, if you use a phone. In short when you call someone, cell tower is used to connect your phone to another one, using cellular network. The cell towers have to know where your phone is to pass on calls/texts. This can be used to track you, no matter if you use Android, IOS, Copperhead or LineageOS. This is how phones work.If you want an actual privacy, consider buying any other device. You don't have to buy a **phone** to use Android or LineageOS on it. Search for any other device, the most important thing in it should be, that it doesn't have a SIM or the ability to put one there.If you ever want to chat with anyone, you can use WeChat, Wire, Signal or whatever the heck else you want to use through wifi.

2656	 quantum_dan	 It's worth noting that you don't have to be offline to have privacy--end-to-end encryption does the job as well (preventing anyone without the key--which no one else has--from reading your stuff), or running your own server for some things.  So for example you could take notes with [Turtl](https://turtlapp.com/) and use your own [Nextcloud](http://nextcloud.com/) server (e.g. with a VPS) to sync tasks (which you can do with typical calendar/task apps supporting CalDAV servers, e.g. using DavDroid to sync with your calendar app on Android).

2667	 stefantalpalaru	 &gt; As Nvidia only provide proprietary drivers this most likely affects Linux users as well.It most likely does not, since we don't have long running processes/services/tasks, like on Windows. Our drivers are kernel modules and shared libraries.

Intel ME, AMD PSP, the motherboard's UEFI, the GPU's firmware (on the board itself, closed source for AMD as well) etc.Windows however actively sends lots of data back, and Microsoft doesn't even try to hide it. Nvidia is also upfront about this in their driver for Windows. There's even an (enabled by default) toggle in the driver settings.As far anyone knows, there's no telemetry in the Linux drivers. No one's captured any network traffic. There are also other ways to analyse what a piece of software is doing, even when it's closed sources. Debuggers, VMs, etc."Well you can't proof it's not sending any data" vs "we know for sure it's sending data."

2688	 KRZ_759	 My experience with AMD drivers has only been within the last year, where they've been open-source, stable, and tightly integrated with Linux, where in my previous experience with proprietary Nvidia drivers for Linux they broke a handful of times.	
2689	 thegilman	 Thanks! I also spent way to much time trying to figure this out

2706	 Liam2349	 Yes, what I meant was that Shadowplay and GameStream probably aren't an exhaustive list of GeForce Experience-requiring technologies.	
2707	 xgwujrep	 May not exist. Sorry.The commercial routers are designed for commercial purposes and work well for that application. Unfortunately - they don't contain many of the features like adaptive traffic shaping which make video wifi, and Voip work right.But if you go with a consumer router, security support or even basic security competence is absent. And of course, all of this is much worse now due to these Meltdown and Spectre vulnerabilities which are affecting *all* processor vendors. So it will take a LONG time (if ever) to learn if your router is affected and if you can even do something about it.Here's an ugly suggestion. Wait. Take that fancy Netgear unit, tweak it for all it can do with Video or Voip - then put all your entertainment stuff on the LAN it creates. This will be your outside, less secure network.Then find an atom ITX board which is not affected by the Spectre bug, build an IPfire router out of it and attach to your netgear router to form a dual NAT network. This second router will control your most secure network. Ideally, you won't allow any machine on that second network which is subject to Spectre to even go to the internet.https://www.grc.com/nat/nats.htmhttps://www.ipfire.org/features This is a hack - because your first router is almost certain to require replacement. This still buys you time.Your concern about security is commendable, but you may not have been paying attention this week. Everything you own will likely require replacement now. Hard to protect anything with a locked door when someone knocks a huge hole in your wall? Kinda pointless? The world has been hit by the black plague for electronics. Most electronics will die.That second atom based router gives you at least a chance to keep badness out (assuming you don't invite badness in). *Every* processor family from every manufacturer was hit. You can't avoid this. Spending money with any manufacturer is a waste of your time and money.	
2708	 nroach44	 How so?```sudo apt-get install nvidia-driver &amp;&amp; reboot```Oh look I have proper gpu drivers.	
2709	 nroach44	 Because it's a lot easier to see if one thing is spying on you when the entire rest of the OS is open source and designed around being able to debug and see everything.	
2710	 JustaReverseFridge	 thats called your vpn sucks ass or your not using it correctly, The reason you use a vpn is so that doesn't happen	
2711	 exmachinalibertas	 One of my computers is Linux with the nvidia proprietary driver. I occasionally wireshark it for a variety of reasons, and at least when I've run it so far nothing has been sent to nvidia domains. That doesn't mean much, and it's still a closed blob, but I thought I'd chime in with my limited experience. The computer runs Arch with the nvidia packages.	
2712	 zigglezip	 Installing the drivers isn't the issue	
2713	 substitute_user	 You won’t find a “Home” Plug&amp;Play Router that will do what you want it to do. Years ago, Cisco made some pretty good Routers that did VPN pretty much out of the Box but I’m not sure they still have them.  If you feel like tinkering a little bit you can setup a Raspberry Pi as VPN Router. 	
2714	 AhmedOfAmerica	 I really recommend factory resetting your phone before reaching customs, or if it's Android at least having a backup profile with nothing installed.	
2715	 ESC-REF-POW	 Yes, but you seem to have a sense of entitlement to this software. You don't. It's offered by Nvidia, their "price" is ridiculous, so you make the sacrifice and don't use it	
2716	 _ahrs	 /r/StallmanWasRight	
2717	 PM_ME_BURNING_FLAGS	 NVidia has the privacy issues the OP mentions, *plus* it's closed source even in your otherwise open system, *plus* it interacts poorly with certain programs like Plymouth. There's a reason [Torvalds gave them the middle finger](https://www.wired.com/2012/06/torvalds-nvidia-linux/), they don't really give a shit about Linux.Specifically on the privacy issues: *it is closed source, you can't trust what it's doing.*A shame nouveau still has miles to go.	
2718	 AnonymousCoward__	 &gt; Best advice is to **not use Facebook then complain they're tracking you**FTFY	
2719	 AnonymousCoward__	 &gt; Should I change my passwords every month or even more frequently?No	
2720	 _ahrs	 The kernel has networking and shared libraries can make use of said networking. Assuming distro's just ship what NVIDIA ships it also wouldn't be too difficult for them to include a systemd unit to regularly phone home.	
2721	 leliel	 Perhaps. But it's pretty obvious that users have a knee jerk reaction to the mere mention of telemetry these days. Look at my post and the op both downvoted into oblivion for suggesting that telemetry could possibly have legitimate uses.  	
2722	 PM_ME_BURNING_FLAGS	 &gt;The ability to find and fix bugs and optimize thanks to telemetry certainly helped.Opt-in anonymous telemetry where the user is fully aware of the nature of the data being sent is okay. The problem is that large businesses - including NVidia - often follow the "it's easier to ask forgiveness than it is to get permission", so they'll happily take control off the computer owner's hands to get some more for themselves.	
2723	 kapisites	 Unplug the mic if you don't want audio being picked up.	
2724	 Liam2349	 You seem to lack the capability of understanding that some people may rely on this software; that people may use a PC for reasons differing from yours.If you don't need or want it, then you don't have to use it and that's fine; but some people do need it, and that's fine too.	
2725	 _ahrs	 Do you trust the compiler that compiled the compiler?	
2726	 ESC-REF-POW	 I'm conscious that others may need to record their screen, but why do you feel that Nvidia owes you their software? While OBS may have a high performance overhead,  it is more privacy conscious.	
2727	 stephenwraysford	 I installed Opnsense on an Intel NUC and have a permanent VPN to a hosted server that I rent. The speeds are acceptable given the overheads of the VPN and I can whitelist hostnames that I want to access without the VPN. No need to purchase commercial hardware. 	
2728	 nroach44	 That's why I said "How so?"	
2729	 nroach44	 W.r.t privacy issues on Linux:I understand the suspicion, but it's a lot easier to audit the blob on Linux than in windows. Plus the driver alone doesn't use telemetry in windows, the installer adds it in. It would have been noticed a long time ago if the installer did anything funny on Linux (the Debian packagers alone have some fancy change tracking). And if they could be bothered risking the trust of the industry users to put it into the driver blob itself that would still be pretty easy to audit. (wireshark on your router, connection logging on the host etc.)Nvidia have previously released full source code for their SHEILD devices, so I'm inclined to believe them when they say that it's closed source due to middle ware or patents.	
2730	 wallawalladoobie	 Its a sealed phone, it'd likely lose its water resistance if I went buggering around in it	
2731	 Liam2349	 I never said that Nvidia owed me their software. I simply said it was better than the alternatives.	
2732	 ESC-REF-POW	 Yes, but with that comes some inherent sense of entitlement when you complain about how it's locked behind an account. You can simply use other software without being condescending about it.	
2733	 Emp202	 But is it really when the price you pay is your privacy? Or is it just better like "Well, Photoshop is much better than GIMP - when you don't pay for it"? 	
2734	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
2735	 cl3ft	 Great tip thank you.	
2736	 leliel	 I'm not arguing that part just saying telemetry can have good uses.	
2737	 Liam2349	 I never complained that it was locked behind an account. You must be mistaking me with someone else.	
2738	 _-IDontReddit-_	 &gt; NVidia has the privacy issues the OP mentionsNo it doesn't. Since when did a random person on the forums, with 3 total posts, providing not even screenshots count as evidence?&gt; it's closed source even in your otherwise open systemIntel ME. AMD PSP. UEFI firmware. GPU firmware (on the card itself).&gt; PlymouthA bootscreen animation software used by 2 distros? Actual Linux games run better on Nvidia cards almost across the board.&gt; it is closed source, you can't trust what it's doingSee above. And there are things that can be done. Debuggers. Network inspection. Connecting the computer through a pi-hole, which people have done and found nothing. Again, no one in all these years have found any evidence Nvidia is collecting telemetry in Linux.	
2739	 Liam2349	 It's better in the sense that it uses almost zero CPU resources, and less GPU resources, when compared to OBS. This makes Shadowplay significantly lighter to run, and far more practical than OBS, especially on PCs with lower processor counts.For example, it is impractical to record with OBS on a 4-processor machine, because the CPU requirements are so high. On a 4670k I have, OBS would use around 7% CPU, but Shadowplay would use around 1%. OBS would even spike to 25% during gameplay, killing my performance. Shadowplay does not have this issue.OBS would use about 12% GPU, and Shadowplay would use around 6%.	
2740	 _-IDontReddit-_	 Which would have been discovered eventually. Even connecting the computer through a pi-hole yields nothing. Besides, DMA is allowed over PCIE, which mean you trust the closed-source firmware on *all* add-in cards to not spy on you.	
2741	 ESC-REF-POW	 That's entirely possible	
2742	 _-IDontReddit-_	 No that's a stupid rule from a bygone era. Change your password if you have reason to suspect it's been compromised. Otherwise changing your passwords regularly tends to reduce the complexity of said passwords. Unless you're using a password manager, in which case all your passwords are unique and it's comparatively harder to get compromised.	
2743	 ninja_stalker	 This is why I only browse the internet in assembly. 	
2744	 Guybrows	 https://youtu.be/U1ffmf6z50EThis project could be a solution. What do you think?	
2745	 Guybrows	 Basically a decentralised internet. Private,secure and autonomous.	
2746	 PM_ME_BURNING_FLAGS	 I understand, and I wasn't contradicting you but adding info. 	
2747	 _ahrs	 &gt; Which would have been discovered **eventually**"Eventually" being the keyword here. I agree it's unlikely Nvidia is phoning home without people noticing but at the same time if this is a new development how long do you think it would take for people to notice? Assuming pi-hole doesn't yet know about the domains Nvidia is using it wouldn't be on the blacklist. People will indeed eventually notice but how long?The point I was trying to make is, yes it's unlikely Nvidia is phoning home but at the same time all it would take for them to do so is to push a new update. We trust Nvidia not to do this but we can't guarantee that they won't.	
2748	 _-IDontReddit-_	 &gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssemblyArguably worse for privacy/security, as WA blobs are a lot harder to analyze than even minimalized JS.	
2749	 _-IDontReddit-_	 No, people are downvoting you because telemetry isn't why Nvidia is successful. Nvidia only added telemetry to Windows drivers since 2016, but Nvidia has overtaken AMD's market share since ~2013. As far as we know, the Linux drivers *don't* have telemetry, yet Nvidia Linux performance has always been decent.	
2750	 ninja_stalker	 Oh. I was just trying to be funny. :(

2785	 uoxuho	 I think the answer to this question depends on a lot of things, and honestly I doubt that you'll be able to create a compromise like the one you're describing and actually make any significant gains to your privacy.Will you need the ability to receive SMS and phone calls in the future? Maybe something like Google Voice will do the trick, though that comes with its own trade-offs. Or perhaps a cheap cell phone plan that you simply keep at home? You could go with a carrier that supports WiFi calling, and only use that, and keep the phone in airplane mode.Who are the people that you'll want to keep regular contact with, and what do they use? If they use iMessage, WhatsApp, or Signal, then you're basically stuck maintaining a phone number so that they have a way to contact you. If you only foresee yourself maintaining regular contact with a few people, and you can convince them to adopt something like Conversations (XMPP+OMEMO) or Wire, then you'll be in much better shape, but how realistic is that?Does the device have to be mobile? If you are able to convince your contacts to adopt a particular service, then why not just use a full-fledged computer, where you have much more control? You could use Wire so that you could engage in text, voice, or video chats with your contacts on their phones, without you needing a phone number or mobile device.If you're looking for a non-cellular mobile device, then I would honestly say your best bet is an iPod Touch or iPad. Getting robust security and timely updates on Android is difficult even on flagship smartphones, and it's only going to be more difficult on non-cellular, iPod Touch-style Android devices, of which there are only a few, and they are afterthoughts from the smartphone manufacturers.I hope that gives you a couple ideas, but ultimately my advice to you is to think hard about what you're actually trying to accomplish. Cell phones, and especially smartphones, have very real privacy implications, but you need to understand what those implications actually are and how they threaten your own life before you can actually accomplish anything.

2787	 uoxuho	 &gt; Also, for when I'm not near Wi-Fi, I'll have to have a way to generate it, maybe via hotspot or something?I think it's safe to say that the biggest general threat of using a cell phone comes from the cellular modem itself. If you're going to use a mobile hotspot for internet connectivity, then you aren't really making any reasonable change there. A hotspot is just as dangerous as a cell phone, perhaps more so if it's just some cheap Chinese thing that a cellular carrier is selling for 50% off.Are you okay using just WiFi? My recommendation would be your computer, or an iPad or iPod Touch.Are you not okay using just WiFi, and need a cellular connection? My recommendation would be to just use a phone.

2820	 _-IDontReddit-_	 Serious? Connect the computer though a pi-hole or some logging service and check the IP it's connecting to. People have done this and found nothing for the Linux drivers (but the windows drivers will connect to some Nvidia IPs). You can also use tear apart the blob (small, since Linux drivers are kernel modules) with a debugger and see if there are syscalls corresponds to networking.

2835	 Guybrows	 When Safe Network goes live it might just provide you some of what you need.https://youtu.be/U1ffmf6z50EPrivate,secure autonomous networking.	
2836	 australian_user	 Have fun :) it's freehttps://itunes.apple.com/au/app/sudo-secure-private-messenger/id982100372?mt=8	
2837	 GraemeVoigt	 Thanks! I'll check it out	
2838	 Guybrows	 https://youtu.be/U1ffmf6z50E	
2839	 ZE1nhhfvnh91sFT3A98g	 Well then...	
2840	 Guybrows	 I think safe coin will be a privacy coin. Acting like digital cash it will be much more anonymous than a lot of the blockchain derived coins.https://youtu.be/U1ffmf6z50E	
2841	 Aerisnovant	 Tutanota sucks! I couldn't register for an email since I was behind a vpn. Unacceptable for a privacy oriented email provider	
2842	 theAMAZINGshow	 Using my algorithm I have detected this is your 6th reddit account	
2843	 twizmwazin	 Or generates a random string and uses a password manager so he doesn't need to remember any of them.	
2844	 UristNewb1	 Saying "get rid of Google play services" is easier than actually doing it, though I do appreciate the advice. I know it's a trade off between practicality and security/privacy in most cases, but are their any alternatives that can run similar applications, or is the consumer just fucked?	
2845	 UristNewb1	 Unfortunately at this point in time...you'd have to pick one or the other, at least for one machine. I'd get an air gapped laptop for security and privacy purposes and then a gaming rig with as much privacy as possible via settings, OS, and software. 	
2846	 ZE1nhhfvnh91sFT3A98g	 It really depends on who you are. It usually needs a verification if you seem suspicious.I never had to input a phone number, or donate, or anything.	
2847	 bruke53	 Only evidence I can point to is a talk I saw awhile back regarding compelled decryption and corporate data retention policies. I will look and see if I can find it again. I'm not a legal professional either, I've been in IT for several years, but I would like to get into cybersecurity. 	
2848	 UristNewb1	 Its literally unhackable, I hear.	
2849	 dove_schmidt	 Thank you, this is awesome.  I don't understand what a double-puppeted bridge is in the context of email.  I read the link and it doesn't seem to make sense.  Could you elaborate?	
2850	 UristNewb1	 Ctrl + Alt + Delete .	
2851	 yes_i_am_retarded	 The problem with usernames is that everyone tries to get a unique one. They should just make it so we all have the same username.	
2852	 dove_schmidt	 So, Nvidia is sending automatic crash reports back without intervention on their windows driver.  You use windows to play games and shouldn't be using it for anything you think is secure anyway.  I bet the crash report software in the playstation and android apps do the same thing.  If someone cares about privacy and vulnerabilities created by closed source software and they are a bit slow.  To me this just sounds like good engineering on Nvidia's part to increase user experience and improve on bug reporting.	
2853	 UristNewb1	 While you're reading the rules, you might try to step outside and have a breath of fresh air. Try to identify the species of birds in your backyard or pot a plant with dirt from your area, or something. Take a shower, feel the heat on your skin. Laugh at a stupid movie with someone you enjoy hanging out with.	
2854	 2abvi6qdvbxh	 That can't be it, I'm going with the typos theory.	
2855	 WaLLy3K	 There's not a whole lot that I know of. Feel free to shoot me any links that seemingly defeat Pi-hole, and I'll see what I can do.	
2856	 australian_user	 How does the POP3 client interact with fully encrypted emails? Where is the private key stored?	
2857	 mrquackalot	 It's a small tool that lists all programs and services that are configured to run during system bootup or login, lets you prevent autostart, and much more. Safe, been using it for years.	
2858	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
2859	 elvenrunelord	 Yes, I have an entitlement to the software. I bought a $800 video card and I expect the software to run it to be included. What I did not expect nor will I accept is an invitation to send a spy to my house to live 24/7 along with it.	
2860	 Trousers_McQuean	 Yes it is because you can register with a fake email and disable the telemetry.Also their software is part of the product and is included in the price of the device so your analogy is not valid. 	
2861	 Guybrows	 https://youtu.be/U1ffmf6z50ECheck out the safe network project. This is a new internet project. It is decentralised, secure, privacy based. One of the interesting things about it is that you will own your own data. So a social media site would operate in a very different way. The revenue model would be very different. The network can pay developers the more people use their application. It uses a digital currency for this wealth creation. So  you decide what happens with your data. If you want to share it fine. If not then your choice.	
2862	 MedianLethalDose	 I've used totally clean hardware, no proxies or anything, fresh browser and internet, but I'm 100% sure you're right that it singles some people out	
2863	 LatticeCrypted	 That username though.

2865	 TheBrainSlug	 openmailbox.org	
2866	 EinCB128	 Thank you, Mr.	
2867	 freebeerheretomorrow	 I guess that you love u/pizza93	
2868	 djpon94	 I'm a pony	
2869	 dove_schmidt	 I know you said "tor access" but would there be a way to make the pop3 client communicate through the tor network to prevent my ISP from knowing I'm using this email service?	
2870	 australian_user	 It's possible to run a POP3/IMAP server with an onion hostname, eg 3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion:465Onion routing isn't just for HTTP(S) :)	
2871	 dignadigna	 I really like the idea of the aliases.  Would they have normal looking account names and not be obviously an alias (like the craigslist re-mailer)?  Since the server will have to maintain a database of what aliases go with what accounts, what will you do to protect that database as it seems like it'd be valuable metadata for a state actor looking to learn about one of your users.  Is there anyway you could provide some sort of per-user canary or some sort of lockout for that data.	
2872	 hardharding	 This people, stop using windows for anything secure.	
2873	 nreisan	 Damn that is crazy :(	
2874	 Emp202	 We're talking about a program installed on your computer that more than likley ties into a device driver with kernel mode access. And you're saying a "fake email" at registration is all you need to preserve privacy? 	
2875	 kazacy	 If you are willing to get your hands "dirty", my advice is [PCEngines](https://www.pcengines.ch/apu3b4.htm). You need to buy also a case, power adapter, and a flash medium for OS (msata MLC SSD it's a good choice).  On this you can install various *nix systems, IPFire, OPNSense etc. Personally i use IPFire, but i tried OPNSense and Ubuntu server. After this you can do almost anything you want, including antivirus, SQUID proxy server, VPN server, torrent client (torrents can be saved on a USB3 external hdd), teamspeak server etc, etc. Pretty much whatever you want.	
2876	 inh-uman	 Uh, AMD has pretty much eliminated their FOSS driver support for a while now. I love AMD, but their FLOSS / Linux driver support is garbage.	
2877	 KRZ_759	 I don't know what opposite universe you've been living in, but AMD's FOSS drivers have progressed immensely in the last year and keep getting more features and performance, to the point of often beating out their own closed-source drivers. They've been putting a lot of focus on their FOSS drivers over their proprietary ones. Just in the last month, they got a ton of code for FreeSync and Vega mainlined into the Linux kernel.	
2878	 UristNewb1	 My god, are you a detective? 	
2879	 UristNewb1	 Can you let us know where you're getting this information? I don't necessarily doubt it but it seems like the kind of information that is fundamentally impossible to know for certain.	
2880	 PresleyWalker	 Can definitely recommend sudo.	
2881	 Trojan_Chicken	 I have been using this for years https://popcorntime.sh	
2882	 australian_user	 Do you/anyone know what happened to French numbers? :(	
2883	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
2884	 9S2B	 You're fine. 	
2885	 avxrie	 What information?	
2886	 snozburger	 Nicely done Briony G, apparently you can't be assed.Well this sucks as the firmware patch also kills sideloaded apps.	
2887	 foundation-Building	 Can you recommend any good password managers? I am up to my eyeballs in passwords to the point where it is unmanageable!! I have always been skeptical of the password managers because i have to trust a third party company right?	
2888	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
2889	 Alisete	 I think you're looking for /r/piracy	
2890	 tn47	 I think if you have a malware on your system and somebody would really want to own you, you wouldn't have a chance either way. The malware author could log your keyboard, monitor your clipboard and other activities, and basically remote control your PC. So when you enter a passphrase for KeePass or LastPass you would be owned. And if you would use the password manager of your browser to login into LastPass, the hypothetical hacker could do that, too.But I *believe* most common malware is not that sophisticated, because to monitor individual persons is way to time-consuming. I think it's much more common to remote control the owned PCs for DDOS attacks, install ransomware or try specific automated attacks like taking over steam or origin accounts. 	
2891	 [deleted]	 17 hours and no reply? Sad.Anyways, they provided a page that explains how you can remove your information from their website https://radaris.com/control/

2893	 [deleted]	 Maybe these guys can help? :) https://removeonlineinformation.com/sign-up/	
2894	 LatticeCrypted	 Whatever you do, don't forget Linux support. This looks good by the way.	
2895	 frenchmontanatheman	 Ubuntu doesn't include that spyware anymore:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29#Amazon_controversyI would agree though that it was totally unacceptable move from their side back then.&gt; Everyone says switch to Linux, but when you pick a distro everyone is like “no, not that one.”Personally, that's what put me off from Linux for years before. I chose wrong distributions and followed wrong advice. The reason I say what I say is that I don't want others to make the same mistakes.&gt; Debian worked after slogging through their unfriendly webpage. INow that you said it, I think I agree. It's rock stable though, and has millions who rely on it everyday.And it's not like the websites of those doggy distros that you mentioned that try to trick the users into paying them money are any better. That Zorin one doesn't even say what DE do they use. It's ridiculous.	
2896	 frenchmontanatheman	 Both are fundamentally unsafe in that use scenario. What might save you however is isolation. For example, as in Qubes OS.	
2897	 recta1anarchy	 alright then	
2898	 TheSacredSoul	 omg....	
2899	 Eidbi	 Does it have a https version of the site?	
2900	 australian_user	 http://www.cock.li redirects to https://www.cock.li for me on mobile (no add ons). So yes?	
2901	 Eidbi	 Linux is safer, as you won't have malware this way.	
2902	 Eidbi	 KeePass.	
2903	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
2904	 Eidbi	 &gt; would I have better privacy if I used a tablet for wifi/wechat + dumbphone (such as Nokia 215) for call/text instead of a smartphone such as Nexus w/Copperhead?Indeed and this is what I recommend you to do. **But** this tablet should support LineageOS.	
2905	 australian_user	 Captcha isn’t available on the onion site, and often lots of the Tor exit IPs have been used to create new accounts so captcha is disable for the exit. ProtonMail is great. It’s just not what the OP asked for. 	
2906	 Eidbi	 Forget about Google Play Store. LineageOS supports MicroG. And there is Yalp as well.	
2907	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
2908	 Eidbi	 Yes, every device, based on Android, which is not a phone is fine. Be sure that it supports custom ROMs, like LineageOS. And you will do fine.	
2909	 Eidbi	 Because they didn't use https instead of http. Like majority of other sites do. Seriously, they shouldn't expect their programs be safe, if they host them at http sites.	
2910	 Eidbi	 That's good.

2915	 tanosaur	 I heard something along the lines of keeping the KeePass program open is a risk. How does this work, and how often?

2917	 tanosaur	 Thanks, will check it out.	
2918	 KrisNM	 If said malware install low level keylogger.. none safer.	
2919	 linerror	 also for those not bothering to read, under full details it is explained that this applies to specific firmware, not hardware, and can be resolved with an update, which WD has already released months ago. 	
2920	 JeffersonsSpirit	 keepassxc. It even has auto-type so you can just press a keybind and have it type the username/password for you. No trusting a third-party necessary as your passwords stay local on your system.	
2921	 XD9mMFv1miW5ITTW	 Touche, my friend.	
2922	 XD9mMFv1miW5ITTW	 We have a winner.	
2923	 LizMcIntyre	 Interesting article by Jeff Spross of The Week. TL;DR:&gt;"...Google, Facebook, and other social giants should be subscription-based services, the same way Netflix is. Their users should be customers. ... We would no longer be bombarded by incessant advertisements, and both platforms would have far less incentive to gather data on our internet behavior or share it with third parties. They'd become far more sensitive to consumer sentiments and complaints in how they designed their algorithms, which would probably have positive spillover effects for all the other businesses that rely on the internet and these platforms."&gt;"How much would it cost us? Well, Facebook pulled in $27.6 billion in revenue in 2016, at the end of which it had around 2 billion active monthly users. Facebook could generate that same amount charging those users a mere $13.80 for a year's subscription."&gt;"Google is slightly more complicated, and likely more expensive. But over all of 2016 it generated around $100 billion in revenue, and across its devices and various internet properties it has around 3 billion active monthly users. That's a little less than $34 per Google user for a year's subscription."	
2924	 RandomSwedishDad	 I agree, they should pay us!	
2925	 [deleted]	 It's impossible to be found out deliberately 'not remembering', because it's impossible to prove you knew when you said you didn't. 	
2926	 As4fN1v	 Yep. Never trust a nonfree NAS	
2927	 As4fN1v	 Why do you even use windows?	
2928	 LizMcIntyre	 Not sure I agree u/RandomSwedishDad. They already "pay" users in services, which promotes the surveillance economy. I like the idea of  subscription based services that are beholden to customers.	
2929	 RandomSwedishDad	 Our information is the tradeoff here. The bigger picture provides analytical possibilities that generates profit.	
2930	 ABaseDePopopopop	 DKIM authentication.Maybe DANE even.	
2931	 varjolintu	 Sounds like you would want something like [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) with [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/).	
2932	 FeatheryAsshole	 thank you for providing the tl;dr.	
2933	 ESC-REF-POW	 The software to run it is included. GeForce experience isn't the driver software. I own an Nvidia card and don't have GeForce experience installed.	
2934	 amunak	 In theory, yes. In practice in a stressful situation many people are susceptible to manipulation, you may give out that you actually know something without even realizing it. If they can prove that you've mislead them you are in a bunch of trouble, so why risk it and make it potentially worse for yourself for no reason?	
2935	 [deleted]	 Pretty right on that, requires more work, but I think it's worth.	
2936	 metiis	 You have a much smaller risk of getting malware, since there is fewer malware targeted at Linux users. Nevertheless, if you execute an unknown file with superuser rights, that program could always be malicious and install malware. Most Linux distributions are considered far safer than Windows/macOS because they have a large community which is able to see and request changes to the source code, eliminating security holes in no time, **once found**. But that advantage will not help you if you yourself install malware. It only means that malware can't be installed as easily without the user's action. Nevertheless, I would prefer a Linux distribution over Windows any day. Not only because the kernel is open source, but also because Linux distributions usually don't ship malware like Windows does.	
2937	 Kajover	 Just out of experience and a little advice. Running a mail server is a pain in the ass. Can you guarantee a 99.9% uptime? No power outages? Zero delays while upgrading the system? Just some thoughts	
2938	 MedianLethalDose	 Phishing emails and sites are up there. Piracy still is a factor. OS X leans towards social engineering tricks, exploiting Apple's wide open by default system, and things like connecting to that network with poisoned DNS. People trawling range of IPs for weak target to exploit, it's not hard to do and then hit hard targeted, I scanned about 40,000 IPs today for reasons unmentioned. Phishing though, and malware which is there because the user installed it (trojan.) Run a website, expect 100 malicious visits the first day at least. It's the wild west.	
2939	 ScatterDeez	 asl?	
2940	 [deleted]	 I work in law enforcement in Australia and can tell you for a fact that it would be impossible to prove someone lied about it (to a sufficient extent, not suspicion or resorting to trying to catch people out). Maybe the US is different.	
2941	 rexroni	 lol linux support is the most important!  I run parabola.	
2942	 greengrasser11	 What's their excuse for ignoring such a glaring security flaw for 6 months.	
2943	 baremonkey	 https://xkcd.com/1807/	
2944	 rexroni	 Right now they are automatically generated from a list of common first and last names, followed by 5 numbers.  So you might get willow.thornton05912 or jimmy.macias02857.	
2945	 rexroni	 &gt; DKIM authentication.&gt; &gt; Maybe DANE evenSure!  DKIM is sort of "standard email tech", like having a valid reverse-dns lookup and a useful SPF.DANE is a lot trickier but will become critically necessary to support the Darkmail Internet Environment that Ladar Levison from Lavabit.com is developing.	
2946	 f7ddfd505a	 Great password btw.^"abc12345cba"	
2947	 rexroni	 Nope, I can't gurantee that yet.  But honestly, as an email user I would gladly accept 95% uptime in order to have the features I listed.  I can do 95% uptime I think.  I read in an RFC that Mail Transfer Agents are supposed to resend for 3 days before giving up.  I don't know if all MTAs practice that but it would make running the server much more forgiving.Right now it is hosted on 1984hosting.com in Iceland, so power outages are handled by another organization (a privacy-focused one).	
2948	 rexroni	 There is a little program that runs on your computer, which reads fully-encrypted email from the server, decrypts it using your private key (stored only on your computer), and then serves a local POP3 interface to whatever email client you want, so those clients don't have to be smart enough to decrypt the email.  It'd be cool to have a thunderbird plugin that did the same, but that's a ways off for me.	
2949	 JDGumby	 Of course, even if they went subscription, they'd still be collecting and using and selling your data.	
2950	 sedicion	 Firefox	
2951	 jtc42	 I retract my suggestion. This idea is better.	
2952	 MedianLethalDose	 I've got bit and pieces of writing sitting around too, pretty huge collection of software for each OS	
2953	 australian_user	 So that’s the same as ProtonMail’s Bridge.

2957	 frankster	 cba to come up with a better password	
2958	 australian_user	 Sure. You have to pay for it though.	
2959	 rexroni	 The matrix network is a style of federated IP communications.  "Federated" means that @yahoo.com accounts can talk to @gmail.com accounts.  Chat services usually aren't federated; Wire accounts and Signal accounts can't talk to each other.  With Matrix, a "double-puppeted bridge" bridges your account with another technology (email in this case) and your account with the matrix network, for two way communications (sending and receiving).  It's called "double puppeted" because the server has to be able to read from email and post as your matrix user, and also read your matrix account and post messages to your email account.  Obviously... each interested party would have to run their own DP bridge, because it has full access to their matrix account.But this is going to be important to me because in Jan 2019ish because I ordered this [shiny puri.sm phone](https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/) that is designed to work on the matrix network.

2964	 zipperkiller	 Yet another reason not to buy WD	
2965	 ApocalypseOfLlamas	 Iridium is quite good for privacy I think.	
2966	 [deleted]	 hmmmmmmm i dont know how that will work out? tbh doesnt sound like a good idea to buy a laptop with prebuilt encryption? fully encrypting your harddrive disk when you install linux should be enough tbh. 15 plus characters and all	
2967	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 Some malware attempts to scrape your memory and Keepass keeps  entries as plaintext in memory, so keep that in mind.	
2968	 _-IDontReddit-_	 KeePass or any of it's variants. Basically you should avoid the commercialised managers like LastPass. The only person you can trust with your passwords is yourself.	
2969	 rexroni	 Also regarding security of the database, the best security I have now is just standard server security measures (and running on only FOSS software, of course).  I like the idea of a per-user canary, but what would "some sort of lockout" look like?	
2970	 australian_user	 Vincent thinks he's a funny cunt? And he loves cocks.(Cunt is not an offensive word in my culture.)	
2971	 rexroni	 No, for two reasons:A) ProtonMail [doesn't encrypt subject lines](https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/does-protonmail-encrypt-email-subjects/), my server does.  I'm guessing all they do is normal GPG encryption (meaning none of the RFC headers are encrypted) but I didn't see anywhere they elaborate on that.and B) my software exists, [ProtonMail's Bridge](https://protonmail.com/bridge/download) doesn't.	
2972	 Liam2349	 Yes and it still doesn't perform nearly as well. This is because the Nvidia encoder, NVENC, is only part of the story. Frame capture is also very important, and OBS does not have access to NVFBC.	
2973	 Eidbi	 Em... https://github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium	
2974	 Eidbi	 Firefox is more Googled than Ungoogled Chromium.	
2975	 Eidbi	 People only use Facebook, because it is free. If it was paid, no one would have used it.	
2976	 13378	 Here are some great tools to disable Nvidia Telemetry and a nice tool that checks and updates the latest driver.Disable Nvidia Telemetryhttps://github.com/NateShoffner/Disable-Nvidia-TelemetryTinyNvidiaUpdateCheckerhttps://github.com/ElPumpo/TinyNvidiaUpdateChecker	
2977	 [deleted]	 [removed]	
2978	 Liam2349	 What are the others? I've heard their reliability is less than Toshiba and Hitachi (HGST, which is now owned by WD anyway).	
2979	 Eidbi	 Does it?	
2980	 australian_user	 They don't encrypt subject lines so subjects are searchable from the web client.They could encrypt subject lines and not have webmail search, like Tutanota did. A business decision doesn't make them inferior.I also don't understand the 'software not existing' comment, unless you mean Linux (which is in production). I've used Bridge for months on Mac. They have a couple million users, so it makes sense for them to release for the biggest user groups first.	
2981	 Eidbi	 &gt;Free version is on Fdroid. Em... What is the difference between paid and free version, if it is open-source?	
2982	 Trousers_McQuean	 No I said that a fake email and disabling the telemetry is what you can do. Otherwise just don't buy Nvidia. If you already have an Nvidia card and are an EU citizen you can request all the information they have on you and they are legally obliged to provide it. 	
2983	 Eidbi	 Do they care about my privacy, or do they collect my data anyway?	
2984	 Liam2349	 I think what you're referring to is something like how Surface devices come with a TPM and use Bitlocker for encryption.Some devices support hardware encryption that can be taken advantage of through the BIOS if you're lucky, and alternatively, you can use Bitlocker if you have a TPM. You may also be able to use VeraCrypt, but I'm not sure if that will just do software encryption.If you just want software encryption, then regardless of anything, you can just encrypt the system disk with VeraCrypt and enter a password on boot. There is something to do with the VeraCrypt boot loader, but there are instructions for it and it should work on most machines.	
2985	 suddenduckmurder	 Contract Law is surprisingly horrifying. People regularly and unintentionally give up their rights.EDIT: fixed typo.	
2986	 Eidbi	 It is open-source. Then again, so is Chromium...If you mean, like is it preferable to use Yalp or MicroG instead of simply using stuff like Fdroid? Then yes, it is better to use Fdroid, or even better to download the apk from official github repos or even better to download apk from the official site. I tend to not trust programs which are only available on Google Play, as god knows what kind of garbage it is. I recommend Yalp or MicroG only for people who would want to continue downloading apps from a store. If people want to completely get away from Google, then yeah, no Yalp, no MicroG, no anything that ever connects to Google.	
2987	 australian_user	 This is sad. I liked DNScrypt and the Icelandic resolver.I'm not going to DNS-over-TLS. I'm currently using DNS-over-VPN and DNS-over-Tor (depending what I'm doing). The only public/unencrypted lookups I'm doing is to my VPN provider. I'll adjust /etc/hosts when I can be bothered.

2995	 twizmwazin	 The other big options are Seagate, HGST, and Toshiba. I personally have a bunch of Toshiba drives in my nas, although that was due to cost with less thought to reliability.Overall I'm gonna say that WD (drives only), Seagate, and HGST have equally good histories. People will become partial to certain brands due to bad experiences with others. Most drives, especially NAS-oriented drives, should come with reasonably long warranties with free data recovery. This, combined with parity raid, should be enough to keep peace of mind for most users.

2998	 easytraveling	 Thanks. Why did you specifically choose IPFire? I've never heard of it. 	
2999	 australian_user	 Definitely not disroot.org. All of your emails are stored unencrypted on their server. Both ProtonMail and Tutanota have apps for Android and iOS. They both encrypt email body on server. ProtonMail supports IMAP (paid accounts). Search is restricted to subject lines as they’re not encrypted. The user community is slightly stronger. Tutanota supports full email search, and all metadata is encrypted on server. They do not support IMAP yet. If you want a free account, honestly, go with the web interface that feels most comfortable between the two.

3004	 kazacy	 To be honest, i am more comfortable with Linux rather than BSD. Also Ubuntu server starting from 2016 it's based on systemd, and despite all my efforts i cannot setup properly the USB external hdd; systemd always manage to random halt my entire setup.  If you want easiest setup, try OPNSense.  P.S. one more reason for me to use IPFire is on OPNSense you cannot install a torrent client or a teamspeak server, basically it's just a very good router and that's all.

3012	 _--__--__--___-_____	 I agree that the experts need to do their best to make it accessible and convenient. The problem though is that security can only be so convenient before it becomes useless. That's why there's such a struggle in the first place. But by helping people change their attitudes towards privacy and security, you can help them redefine what's convenient to them. House locks are a great example. It's a much less convenient way to get in and out of a door than just pushing it open, but no one even thinks it's an inconvenience because their attitude towards keeping their house safe is one where locking your door doesn't even require thought. People don't take that approach with their personal devices and or don't realize that it's more like playing in an open field (on the internet) than it is being inside an enclosed building and more stringint security is needed. If we we focus on helping people realize that, then having them use 2fa because much less inconvenient.

3036	 loosedata	 Because Linux barely runs on my hardware.	
3037	 rm-minus-r	 It's definitely good to keep privacy in mind, most of humanity doesn't!As far as what switching to Linux will do for you in terms of privacy, it's mostly the fact that it gives you a far greater amount of control over the information that leaves your computer. All of that is because Linux is open source, you can look under the hood and see exactly what is doing what (or pay attention to the internet posts of people that do spend their time looking under the hood), unlike Windows where it can upload information and you'd be none the wiser unless you spent a lot of time sorting through all your network traffic and had a large degree of expertise in that area.To take advantage of that though, you have to know what kind of information you want to control and what threats you have to consider.Some information you'll have to give out if you want to browse the internet. Even if you browse everything in HTTPS, your ISP and every server between your ISP and the website you end up at will be able to see what URL you're going to, even if the contents of the page come back encrypted with HTTPS.Every DNS request you make (so when you type in www.google.com, your computer can resolve it to an IP address that it can actually use) can be logged somewhere along the way, definitely at your ISP and without much difficulty at any of the DNS servers your computer might need to access past your ISP.The NSA and the like almost certainly still operate something like PRISM (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program) for details), where they essentially installed optical splitters in various key internet backbones, copying every single bit of internet traffic that passed through the US (and likely the UK and anywhere else they could get enough traction to install such things), so it is not unreasonable in the least to believe that the government has a copy of anything you've done on the internet. Odds are you'll never stick out amongst the hundreds of millions of Americans that browse the internet, but security through obscurity is a terrible defense in general.Microsoft has been known to collect data from Windows, and in general, while they maintain that they don't use it for any peeping tom type purposes, it is better to not have to place your trust in Microsoft than to be forced to do so.And after all that, you have hackers and phishers. Linux can be secured against hackers far more easily than Windows can, but it's hardly immune either if you don't know what you're doing.There's plenty of threats to privacy out there, you just have to figure out which ones matter and which ones don't.The only way to truly have privacy is to live out in the woods with no contact at all with humanity, but most of us aren't up for that hah.

3040	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Fun fact: I have never posted on reddit outside of Tor. I would encourage others to do the same if they are able. I would also advise to use Torbrowser in a virtualized environment (VM, like Whonix on Virtualbox, KVM, or Qubes/xen). Make it *really* expensive for them to track your person and it wont be financially worth doing so.They can still track you according to your habits under a given account, and they can also put together a very complete picture from all the little details you post. It is important to be careful to control the information you post here, and even better to post *false* information to fuck up their plans. Its generally also a good idea to get new accounts quite often so that your account doesn't have a huge store of personal crap about you- its more expensive in terms of labor or AI or whatever to put those accounts together (and inevitably less accurate). OTOH I don't bother with this account (in that I haven't made a newer one). I want them to see how rabidly in support of a free society I am; I am one asshole in a sea of millions, but there are many more like me and they need to know... If we meekly hide our support for the preservation of our liberties, we will never be aware that others like us exist and we- a hopefully sizeable minority irate and powerful enough to make a difference- will watch tyranny roll in as we falsely believe we are all alone in this fight. I guess in this case excessive meekness breeds apathy, and we already have way more apathy than is healthy for a free society...

3043	 otherreddituser2017	 I found this on their website:Is Vivaldi Open Source?Vivaldi is not made available under one unified open source license. It does contain the Chromium source code with changes made to allow the HTML/CSS/JS based UI to run. All changes to the Chromium source code are made available under a BSD license and can be read by anyone on vivaldi.com/source/. Details in this regard are explained in the the README and LICENSE files within the package. In addition, our UI code is written in plain, accessible code for those who read HTML, CSS and JS. This means that for all practical purposes the Vivaldi source code is available for audit. Vivaldi also contains third party code. Licenses for these parts can be found in the source package and in the installed browser at vivaldi://credits https://help.vivaldi.com/article/is-vivaldi-open-source/So it seems to be open enough to trust? I don't like chromium because it still sends stuff to Google, but Vivaldi has completely cut them off. They explain more in their website.	
3044	 Autism_Tylr_Schaffer	 Perhaps you should try harder to understand the basic fundamentals of cryptocurrency before spewing your ignorance.	
3045	 adrianpeter	 Camelot?	
3046	 dignadigna	 Maybe the entry for the specific user could be encrypted using the user's password and the server would only be able to open that entry for use within a few minutes of the user checking for mail and then it'd go away.  The only downside to this is the server would then have to maintain all incoming mail it didn't have a home for somewhere else until the user logged in.  My other thought was that the canary (should it die) would disconnect all previous aliases and make the mailbox read only to force said user to start over.  I'm not sure about the legality of that last part.	
3047	 loosedata	 It makes my Wifi constantly cut out, all the windows lag when dragging, I get constant flickering on the screen and a bunch of other issues.	
3048	 dignadigna	 Not having a linux version yet has kept me from using ProtonMail.  I don't own a mac and don't intend to.  I understand why they did it, however I don't see how they couldn't write software that worked with both as many linux projects compile just find on a mac.	
3049	 threwthelookinggrass	 If you're encrypting before uploading to the cloud is there any danger?

3053	 Drew4	 It depends on how good your encryption is.	
3054	 TrashMacNugget	 I would recommend that, but it seems there are issues with signing up over Tor. I've tried many times, from different exits, and it never works. It also often won't work because I have to do a CAPTCHA, and Google won't even show me a CAPTCHA because I use Tor.	
3055	 rachcookie	 Sounds like a great way to lose customers. I'll take my packaging without a chip in it, thanks	
3056	 ipev	 It's intentional	
3057	 JeffersonsSpirit	 You only need to get crafty once to get your login, so maybe you can find a way around this. When I signed up a year ago, they didn't seem to care I was on Tor and gave me an account. I did use an email at the time, but it was SIGAINT which was an email that you could create for free over Tor but that had a clearnet receiver. I immediately removed that account from Reddit once my account was made- I didn't trust the account at all but figured it might prevent issues with signing up over Tor. Maybe a comparable Tor service exists for email, and perhaps Reddit would be fine with signing up over Tor if you had such an email?Also, have you tried a proxy *like startpage or searx.me?* Maybe because those are a formal site it will work without triggering reddits protections? So, torbrowser --&gt; searx.me --&gt;  select "proxy" to see reddit --&gt; sign up.I think I'm going to set up some spare accounts if I am able just in case it eventually becomes impossible (if it isn't already).I should also note I find it very suspicious how *every* service seems to be trying to prevent Tor sign ups, and how email services drive so hard to get your phone number. I understand its to prevent abuse in some cases (or at least thats the excuse), but there almost seems to also be something we aren't being told (like they are required to do so and we aren't aware).

3060	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Hardware encryption is great for preventing evil maid style attacks where the adversary modifies your bootloader or /boot partition to dump your encryption key for later retrieval and use. Now, in order to compromise the hardware encryption, they have to compromise the UEFI firmware which can be easy to very hard depending on the manufacturer. And then once you've managed that you still have the software encryption to deal with. Hardware encryption can be excellent if the SSD manufacturer has a good policy- or straight up just says "if you lose your key we can't get the data ourselves because its impossible." While I don't necessarily trust them- they probably have a way and im sure they'd do it for the .gov- they aren't going to do it for anyone else. So basically, its compromise the UEFI firmware if the password is even stored within its memory banks; I'm unsure of hashes and all that- it might be depending on implementation that the UEFI doesn't even have the password stored at all (and thus even compromising the UEFI won't help). I'll have to research this.Yes, the adversary could install a camera or USB keylogger to get your hardware encryption password- thats another battle altogether. But again, that means your adversary has to want it more than your average evil made, and it raises the cost of the attack (and the legal liability as more crimes are being committed). You could try to approach a solution here by using a keyfile for your software encryption- camera and USB keylogger won't help. Now they need 3 trips- once to install the USB keylogger/camera to get the hardware encryption password, another to unlock the SSD and apply their hack to the bootloader or /boot kernel/init/microcode images, and finally a third trip to get the laptop (with the now stored encryption key for luks/veracrypt) so they can use all this information to get access to your files.The general rule is that you're fucked once local access is gained by your adversary, but you can prolong things with a strong dual hardware/software encryption setup.OP, from what I know you're going to want a business class laptop for this- look at what businesses use to prevent corporate espionage. Thinkpads often are used for this, as are some others by HP and so on. I'm not up to date enough to give you a model, but you can try looking in this direction...

3067	 NonappointiveRigel	 &gt;Adopting a homegrown cryptocurrency could give Telegram’s payment system enormous independence from any government or bankUse an existing cryptocurrency instead.

See also [software bloat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat).&gt;The white paper also makes clear that four percent of the supply of Grams (200 million Grams) will be reserved for Telegram’s development team with a four-year vesting period. Telegram also plans to retain “at least 52 percent” of the entire supply of the Grams cryptocurrency to protect it from speculative trading and maintain flexibility. The remaining 44 percent will be sold in both the public and private sale.Oh, I see, it's just a moneymaking scheme.

3076	 TrashMacNugget	 If something goes over HTTPS, your internet provider can only see _who_ you're connecting to (e.g. wikipedia.org), but not what you're accessing (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013–present)).You can use a VPN, so your ISP can't see what you're doing, only that you're using a VPN. Because of the way VPNs work, the VPN provider can see whatever your ISP would've seen. VPNs cost money, and free VPNs are generally not trustworthy.There is also Tor (free, but slower), which bounces your connection between proxies before going to the end website. This way, the endpoint can see what your ISP could've seen, but they _can't see who_ is sending it.	
3077	 berryer	 Per the article, iframe injection can get to the NAS from any computer on its local network	
3078	 LizMcIntyre	 That would be a good thing IMHO. ;-)	
3079	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I think for any operating system the number one place where you are vulnerable is your web browser. Meltdown and Spectre demonstrated this in a horrific way- while they are due to a hardware problem and untrusted applications could exploit them, so too could javascript from a website. Javascript is everywhere on the web.You should do everything possible to ensure your webbrowser is as locked down as possible. I think Meltdown and Spectre make a solid argument for "NoScript or uMatrix are the most important pieces of security software on your computer," though I'm not convinced thats quite true myself (they are definitely up there though). Mandatory Access Control (SELInux, AppArmor, Tomoyo) is great to have, firejail if you run Linux (IMO user namespaces are an unknown so remove the "noroot" option from its profiles) is great for seccomp-bpf (and more), if on Firefox a solid user.js that disables the browser accepting weak encryption forms and hardens many other aspects, and of course making sure you are religious about updating your system (I dont think I can stress this enough).The web browser runs tons and tons of untrusted code from first and third party sources, has a massive attack surface, and is a prime target. Being directly hacked from a network is difficult if you use https sites and have a solid firewall (though not impossible). Viruses are viable for Windows and somewhat MacOS but usually come in via javascript processed in the web browser. Local attackers can happen, but shutting down your computer and using a solid encryption option (luks, veracrypt) will thwart all but the most determined attacker.I suppose I'd put bittorrent in second place- you are pulling software/videos/music/whatever from untrusted sources and there are various schemes to get malwared stuff pumped to the top of the seeders/leechers list if they are determined enough. Still, this is much harder to pull off then an exploit through a web browser.If you use Linux and install software through your distributions repos, you can pretty much trust your software. I'm kind of rambling here but you get the point- get a solid browser, lock it down, and get something to control javascript as best you can. That last part can be a real pain (and its getting harder every year), but for now it seems necessary to me in order to have a good chance at avoiding compromise of your system.

3086	 TrashMacNugget	 &gt; What's stopping me from buying or renting a second, very cheap house and using that second home as my address everywhere? I could send all my mail there, use that address on official forms, etc.Why that as opposed to a P.O. box?	
3087	 Rubes2525	 At what point do we say "yea, maybe this doesn't need to be automated"? Is there really a market for people who will bend over backwards to give out data because they can't stock their own fridge?	
3088	 WrightlyOdd	 To directly answer your question, nothing is stopping you from buy a seconded cheaper home. It just doesn't make a lot of sense. You want something from a bank or a credit card company like a loan or a line of credit, they are going to either just pull a credit report and see where you have lived, which exposes your current address or demand that you provide them the information of the last few places you have lived. To me this would include the current home and the cheaper home for at least a while.P.O Box make way more sense and less hassle than buying a second house. I would also assume that one could properly do something to enhance the privacy that a P.O Box might afford them. Not to say you can do anything, but you bought a home, your in the system. The address for your current home is out there and there isn't much you can do. 	
3089	 fredanderssen	 And yet, Apple released patches for Meltdown/Spectre for their previous three OSes at the beginning of December, and Linux rolled one out when it was announced to the public, in the first week of January. So much for being Johnny on the spot.

3093	 JeffersonsSpirit	 This would suggest that we have a level of tyranny most of even the most paranoid of us here think is not *currently likely.* Nonetheless, it is a very good question, and like you I am tempted to fear the same thing.For example, I have never hosted anything in the cloud that I wouldn't mind the world seeing, even though I dd/luks/ext4/file before I upload.How big is the risk? I think its impossible to quantify really, and thats mainly because we have shit for transparency of power today. It could be that no such desire exists, or it could be an active plot.I will mention a few things I've noted:- It is getting increasingly difficult to do *anything* anonymous online these days. Facebook/Google/etc, captchas that sometimes magically don't work no matter how many you fill out, needing a phone number or picture id to sign up or unlock a service, etc. It used to require a little effort, but increasingly Tor is required just to have a chance. There may come a time where active exploits are flying around and you'll need Qubes or Whonix, though thats only ostensible and thus speculation.- Border/Customs trying to get US citizens to unlock their phones *where the phones then disappear for a period of time* and now recently this is being pushed at the *threat of losing one's device for 5 days if you don't comply.* - Encrypted drives/phones being imaged... for what purpose? If they don't have have the password they can't get in right? Why store it unless...I don't know is the answer. The reality is none of us know for certain. I will say more philosophically that given enough time and enough shadow to hide their monsters in, tyrants always end up being horribly brutal if something doesn't check them. For this fact, I would say its at least likely.	
3094	 rexroni	 Honestly I was confused by their user interface, which says "coming soon" for windows, mac, and linux, even though I see now they offer windows and mac already.  And it is their right to make their business decisions but for those of us who don't want our subjects (or any other metadata of the email) to sit unencrypted on any server it actually *does* make them an inferior option.	
3095	 rexroni	 Well yes but the "different domain" would only be Matrix.  You can read what they are about [here](https://matrix.org/docs/guides/faq.html#what-is-matrix).  I think what the Matrix team is doing is really cool and it would be neat to connect an email server into their project.  I don't know of any mail services that have that feature currently.

3098	 AlcoholicAsianJesus	 Yeah. Very interesting.&gt;As I have mentioned earlier in this article, I found it peculiar that the username used for the backdoor is "mydlinkBRionyg", and that the vulnerability in Section 1 of this paper refers to a non existent file nameof "mydlink.cgi". This really piqued my curiosity, and so I started usinggoogle to try to track down some leads. After searching for the term of"mydlink.cgi" I came across a reference to a post made by a D-Link userregarding their D-Link DNS-320L ShareCenter NAS device.[2]&gt;Within that post were references to file names and directory structure thatwere fairly unique, and from the D-link device. But, they also perfectly matched my WDMyCloud device. The more I looked into this the weirder it seemed. So, I gained access to a D-Link DNS-320L ShareCenter. Once I had it things became pretty clear to me as the D-Link DNS-320L had the same exact hard coded backdoor and same exact file upload vulnerability that was present within the WDMyCloud. So, it seems that the WDMyCloud software shares a large amount of the D-Link DNS-320L code, backdoor and all. There are also other undeniable examples such as misspelled function names and other anomalies that match up within both the WDMyCloud and the D-Link DNS-320L ShareCenter code.&gt;It should be noted that unlike the WDMyCloud the D-Link DNS-320L is currently NOT vulnerable to the backdoor and file upload issues, so you should upgrade your DNS-320L firmware as soon as possible as the issues canbe leveraged to gain a remote root shell on the DNS-320L if you are not upto date with your device firmware. The backdoor was first removed in the 1.0.6 firmware release. (July 28, 2014)&gt;It is interesting to think about how before D-Link updated their software two of the most popular NAS device families in the world, sold by two of the most popular tech companies in the world were both vulnerable at the same time, to the same backdoor for a while. The time frame in which both devices were vulnerable at the same time in the wild was roughly from early 2014 to later in 2014 based on comparing firmware release note dates.

3103	 maciozo	 Unless the source is available, assume it just opens a different backdoor.	
3104	 rexroni	 Hm... do you think unencrypted but expiring aliases would be sufficient?  The issue with encryption schemes for aliases is that the server needs mostly unfettered access to them in order to receive mail (and bounce bad aliases) and verify that new aliases don't collide.  I have toyed with expiring aliases but I haven't implemented them yet.  Deleted aliases (which you can do already) are not remembered in any way.I like a canary to alert each user but I don't know but I think starting the account fresh would have to be up to the user, not the server.  They might not care if authorities grabbed their list of aliases and a bunch of encrypted blobs.  And if the user used expiring aliases and POP3 (set to delete on the server) then there might be literally nothing for authorities to grab.

It hides DNS queries even from your VPN, and some of the servers even implement DNSSEC, which is better than using Tor. Most importantly, most of the servers claim not to log - we know there are bad Tor exit nodes which *do* log.

3140	 geekynerdynerd	 It's viewed as a big deal when it suits people. There are two different viewpoints on how the Constitution should be delt with. On the one hand, there is the "Living Document" interpretation, that says the Constitution is alive and the meaning of it's words changes with the times. The other is the "Original Intent" philosophy, which says that the meaning is unchanging, and the only legitimate method of altering the Constitution is via the Amdendment Process. Others adhere to the concept of "Original Intent". The idea that Congress must declare war for us to invade is based on Original Intent, the justifications for invading Iraq are only "Constitutional" under the Living Document approach. That's not to say that everything about that approach is bad per say, Gay Marriage couldn't have been legalized without using the "Living Document" approach, as our Constitution would have all laws related to marriage handled by the States and not the federal government. There are tradeoffs. By effectively abandoning the Constitution by allowing it's meaning and impact be altered without the amendment process our country has been able to adapt faster than our Constitution would actually allow. On the other hand, it also enabled the erosion of our civil liberties and enabled our President to single handedly declare wars by referring to them as nothing more than "military campaigns". So yeah. We technically "follow" our Constitution, when it's convenient.

3145	 Person_from_Nowhere	 I've heard of some Chinese based companies doing something like this. They'll send cheap, random items to an address or several addresses that they've obtained somehow.

It's the same hassle as building a PC, then installing an OS. In fact, a secure OS is all you need so a cheap or 2nd hand office PC can be a NAS.A NAS is a network connected computer, so you have to configure and lock it down like one if you want privacy.

3180	 JeffersonsSpirit	 /u/TrashMacNugget has a great reply, but I want to clarify one part.Technically, your ISP can still collect *some* data about you when you use a VPN and even Tor. For example, they can know that your household is active online from X to Y time of day/night. They can also generally tell by pattern of requests if you are using a particular streaming service (though certainly not what you're streaming), youtube, netflix, etc. You can try to combat this by adding "noise"- downloading stuff additional to the service you're using (e.g. start downloading a linux distro via bittorrent with a download limit set (don't do this on Tor though), then delete afterwards) to mask and confuse them, etc.But as he says, you've basically cut them out of the loop. They can't see what domains you visit (google.com, reddit.com, etc), what email you use, etc. Browsing most simple webpages are going to be nearly impossible to track in any way.Also, doing the kind of inspection I talk about while possible is *probably not profitable enough.* Corporations everywhere are all about data collection and in a way the increasing supply of data lessens the value of small subsets of data- analyzing as I mention above is *expensive* in terms of either human labor, computing power (running software to try and interpret and sort the data), and thus general load. Why bother? VPN users are a tiny fraction of their home customers and thus not really worth the hassle compared to the bucks they can make watching everyone else, so they prolly wouldn't go to the trouble.This type of analyzing is also much less precise and prone to a higher percentage of inaccuracy. This just makes the data worth less.As he suggests in his reply, a VPN just moves trust from your computer to the VPN provider. Technically the VPN provider could track you and sell data. Worse, VPNs have *shit* for oversight, and traditionally a lack of oversight results in corruption and greedy behavior. OTOH, VPN providers don't have a monopoly like most ISPs, and they also know that if the knowledge of them spying on the wire gets out *their business is done.* Thats a strong incentive to not spy on their users.VPNs are also useful for protecting yourself on open wifi (starbucks etc)- it completely blinds local attackers as to your habits, and makes man in the middle attacks even on http sites impossible for the local attacker to pull off. Tor can do all of this too, but its often slower and thats not really what it was *designed* for (obscuring your IP address, and thus disconnecting your browsing from your person).

3199	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; In fact, it turns out that police officers throughout Oregon have been rummaging through people's trash for more than three decades. Portland drug cops conduct"garbage pulls" once or twice per monthThe lesson here is to be more vigilant about trash.* Shred everything that will fit into the shredder.* Disperse discards among multiple loads (throw parts of something out this week, and parts next week).* Burn particularly sensitive items.* Throw out items that cannot be burned into receptacles other than your own. * Make sure anything personally identifiable (like address labels) are torn off discarded parcel packaging. Essentially the guiding principle to follow when throwing out trash is to anonymize or de-link the trash from you as much as possible.

Killings of prominent journalists such as Gauri Lankesh and Sudip Datta Bhowmik have sparked protests around the country.The lesson here is unambiguous: if you are going to be a whistleblower, or expose any vulnerabilities, you need to maintain your anonymity or you will face harassment.

3219	 thereisnoprivacy	 This video is endemic of the issue with conference presentations in general: the signal-to-noise ratio is very low. The video is about an hour long. The first ten minutes are the presenters regurgitating a few historical highlights of bugs from the [Crypto Museum](http://cryptomuseum.com/covert/bugs/index.htm) (even the photos in their slides have Crypto Museum watermarks). Anyone interested in notable historical examples of covert listening devices would be better served by actually going to said site and reading about these and many other examples themselves. The practical takeaways of the remaining 50 minutes of the presentation can basically be summarized as follows:* To help locate FM (and to an apparently much lesser extent, GSM) bugs, you can use the program [Salamandra](https://github.com/eldraco/Salamandra) (developed by the presenters), in combination with an SDR USB dongle. * Alternatively, you can use the stand-alone [Ghost](https://www.amazon.com/Tukzer-Anti-Spy-Detection-Searching-Protection/dp/B00VRG4NLS/) device.And that's pretty much it. I just saved you an hour. You're welcome.	
3220	 waptaff	 AFAIK, DNSSEC only adds signatures to the response, so from an eavesdropping point-of-view:1) Your ISP sees.2) If your DNS queries are routed via your VPN, your ISP does not see, DNSSEC changes nothing.3) Your ISP does not see.

3248	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 &gt; Website fingerprinting enables a local eavesdropper to determine which websites a user is visiting over an encrypted connection, and the state-of-the-art attacks have been shown to be effective even when the user is protecting her privacy with the Tor anonymity system. Recently, lightweight website fingerprinting defenses for Tor have emerged that substantially degrade existing attacks, including WTF-PAD and Walkie-Talkie. In this work, we propose a new website fingerprinting attack against Tor that leverages a type of deep learning called convolution neural networks (CNN), and we evaluate this attack against WTF-PAD and Walkie-Talkie. The CNN attack attains over 98% accuracy on Tor traffic without defenses, better than all prior attacks, and it is also effective against WTF-PAD with over 90% accuracy. Walkie-Talkie remains effective, holding the attack to just 53% accuracy. In a realistic open-world setting, the CNN attack remains effective, with a 93% true positive rate and a less than 1% false positive rate on undefended traffic. Against traffic defended with WTF-PAD in this setting, the attack still can get a 60% true positive rate with a less than 1% false positive rate. These findings indicate a need for more study of robust defenses that could be deployed in Tor.

3256	 Paranoidsbible	 Could these be "thank you" gifts from recent orders? Double check your recent order history to see if you ordered from these sellers, at all. This could be a gift from them, especially if you left a review. Some do this but they usually tell you if they offer such things.If it isn't anything like a "thank you" gift, then yeah... Sounds stalkerishDo you and/or your wife have social media? How public are these accounts? Do you have anything in the way of blogs that people can find? Does your wife or you post images of her online?Might I suggest https://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/infosec ? Look for the guide called "Paranoid's Bible". Read up on it and follow that to remove and purge information off the net while allowing you to possibly find any odd posts that discuss you at all.I'd also recommend, just to be safe, that you change passwords for any and all accounts that both of you own. This is just to prevent any possible future incidents. Lock your accounts (if you can) so only people you approve of can view them. If you can, further lock stuff down by making them as private as possible. Now, start checking through friend and contact lists, see if there's anyone a bit odd there that might be a suspect. I'd also suggest you and your wife sit down, think of anyone or anything that stands out, person or incident.REMEMBER: Do not throw these items away, ever!Take pictures of them, make a note of the date and time when they came. What the items were and from which seller. This is so you have physical evidence and a possible timeline of when things started to come in the mail. Also include the fact that you discussed this with Amazon.Please check to see who delivers these packages, too. It's odd to have the same Amazon delivery person for every delivery. So make note if it is the same person. Never confront them, that's a job for the police. While you never stated if it was the post or an Amazon deliver, we have had a person send us their story about a stalker-ish deliver who'd leave gifts.Keep all this information both written down and typed up. Include pictures, times and dates. Go to the police, explain the situation. Ask for their opinion of what to do in case things progress into more physical and/or violent route. I'd also recommend that you always ensure that all windows and doors remain locked when you're not outside. Check cars, too, to make sure they remain locked and aren't screwed with when not in use. Always get mail and packages as soon as possible when they are delivered to prevent people from screwing with them. Also, get some latex gloves. You can open and check the content of packages, however not destroy any potential evidence like fingerprints.Finally, if you have a security camera, checkout your property. See if you noticed anything weird or odd, like a car or person coming by a few too many times. It doesn't sound like ID theft, and no one came forward or did anything, yet, that can be claimed as harassment, so... just document your information and remove as much information as possible that you can find online.

3259	 lethalmanhole	 &gt;If the encryption whiners get their way on policy and legislation, they’ll face two utterly predictable outcomes:&gt;First, “the bad guys” — terrorists and criminals, real and imagined — will continue to use strong encryption. The problem with outlawing math and logic is that neither criminals nor math and logic give a hoot about human desires masquerading as “laws.”&gt;Second, countries where governments try to require “back doors” in encryption and other similarly stupid ideas will become losers in the race to the future. Tech companies in those countries will either go out of business or move their operations to jurisdictions where they’re allowed to serve their customers without Christopher Wray’s permission.Taken from [counterpunch.org](https://www.counterpunch.org/2017/10/26/encryption-christopher-wrays-huge-huge-problem-is-an-age-old-inconvenience/)As a side note, it's funny that this story is cycling again when the link above is from this past October.	
3260	 DrDougExeter	 Quantum is irrelevant unless you're talking about cracking crypto from decades ago.   Trying to crack modern crypto on a modern quantum computer is hardly better than trying to crack it with a standard computer.  The time frames involved are so long that it doesn't matter.It will be feasible in the near future to crack today's crypto but hopefully by then quantum-proof will be widely used.	
3261	 ld2gj	 &gt; We told Schrunk that we intended to report that his garbage contained mementos of his military service. "Don't burn me on that," he implored. "The Marine Corps will shoot me!" I can believe that. 	
3262	 barelyephemeral	 is a great idea - but what does it mean? And who owns the meta-data about your data and interactions?! that's REALLY interesting and intellectually and politically stimulating....I think ;)	
3263	 maosredbrook	 &gt; Quantum is irrelevant unless you're talking about cracking crypto from decades ago.*The problem with currently popular algorithms is that their security relies on one of three hard mathematical problems: the integer factorization problem, the discrete logarithm problem or the elliptic-curve discrete logarithm problem. All of these problems can be easily solved on a sufficiently powerful quantum computer running Shor's algorithm.* - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography)Hopefully we will have quantum-proof crypto soon, NIST is working on it, but we're not there yet.

3268	 Cansurfer	 &gt; “urgent public safety issue,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said..Sure is. Everyone should be properly encrypting their device with unbreakable (assuming it is...) encryption to keep themselves safe.	
3269	 Sovos	 Snowden left the U.S. to a non-extradition country before the leaks were revealed, and the U.S. still [tried to strongarm](http://swampland.time.com/2013/06/23/u-s-government-disappointed-hong-kong-let-snowden-leave-country/) Hong Kong into extraditing him.&gt; “If Hong Kong doesn’t act soon, it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about Hong Kong’s commitment to the rule of law.”Not saying it's a bad idea, Snowden has definitely solidified himself as a public figure who supports privacy and backed up his beliefs with action, but there are always risks before to a whistle-blower before they might reach that level of international fame.	
3270	 Isgrimnur	 Good.	
3271	 ManOfCactus	 And you lost me on "Get rid of your Android and use an iPhone" Because a device running a closed source OS is eventually better than an Android running LineageOS with nightly updates? Why not suggesting Copperhead OS devices then as well.	
3272	 Cansurfer	 That's discussing public key systems. Which Android or Apple device encryption...are NOT.  AES relies on none of the above.	
3273	 ezra_balls	 He's absolutely right. We need to do everything we can to ensure it remains unbreakable, what with advances in computing and all	
3274	 Sovos	 In this case, it lends credibility to her claims. She can respond to questions from other organizations and politicians who may want to help.I guess every whistleblower has to make a pros/cons decision on staying anonymous.	
3275	 bdoguru	 These Bureaucrats are treasonous imo. Fourth amendment grants me the right as a law abiding citizen to keep my information unbreakably encrypted	
3276	 Questioner200	 Assymetric encryption (used for encrypted communication) is the most threatened by quantum computers and thus is the major focus of trying to find solutions to that threat. Symmetric encryption (used primarily for encrypted storage) has been seen by many as being less inherently threatened by quantum computers and it has been posited by some that we don't need to use different algorithms for symmetric encryption but we just need to increase their key sizes (usually doubling is recommended). However, those increased key sizes are not implemented ANYWHERE currently so the current implementations of symmetric encryption (no matter how "easy" it is to improve that encryption) EVERYWHERE would be broken by a quantum computer. So, in short, no currently encrypted data in the world is safe right now, particularly if it's being stored by adversaries waiting for the opportunity to break it when technology allows. The challenges for quantum-proofing different kinds of encryption are different, but the basic fact remains the same that the status quo is breakable. Let's all hope that the NIST process doesn't take too many years and that quantum computers take many more years to exist. Unfortunately, both processes are out of our hands and it's a dangerous waiting game.	
3277	 PrivacyNoob	 Thank you! If I use Tor, will my ISP know if I'm using it?	
3278	 GoodolBoat	 I've just read a thing that might help. Apparently you can just print a sticker and place it in your picture:For reference see this article on The Verge: https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/3/16844842/ai-computer-vision-trick-adversarial-patches-googleHere's the paper they're referring to: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.09665.pdf	
3279	 TrueWastage	 Actually come to think of it, it was a really bad example on my part for what I was trying to argue. It is a demonstration that staying anonymous is not possible even if you're a professional though.	
3280	 Cansurfer	 &gt; However, those increased key sizes are not implemented ANYWHERE currently so the current implementations of symmetric encryption (no matter how "easy" it is to improve that encryption) EVERYWHERE would be broken by a quantum computer.I'd be curious to know how powerful a quantum computer would need to be to break a 128 bit AES key in a meaningfully short length of time.  Likely more powerful than anything on the drawing boards for the next decade or 3.  And your criminal case would need to be important indeed to be worth time on that $200 Billion beast.	
3281	 Y783ZO22MDBQ9S2	 &gt; Is your device in full privacy??Is the hardware itself? Then nope.Downstream, the OS is doing what it can, but even the linux kernel has been lapsing quickly on security so far this year.

The server could maintain a list of hashes of all aliases using a one way hashing algorithm like is used for passwords.  The server could use this to bounce emails to non-existing accounts and check to see if alias is already taken.  When the server does receive an email for an existing alias it puts it in a holding account when the email can be retrieved and placed in the right inbox when the user logs in and supplies verification they own that alias.

3311	 smurfhunter99	 This is one of the fucking stupidest arguments of all time in the cat and mouse game that is the FBI trying to obtain every piece of information they can. FBI, guess what? You've never been able to have all of the information, and just because technology is improving doesn't mean you will now be able to. If you're telling me you're able to make EVERY form of unbreakable encryption illegal (I can think of a few that will almost certainly not be going away for decades off the top of my head, especially with the Linux community; LUKS and GPG both come to mind pretty quickly, as well as OVPN), you are fucking high. This fight will at most get you backdoor access to a few more messaging clients and maybe will get samsung to backdoor their phones. You will never be able to decrypt every device in existence.	
3312	 playaspec	 &gt; I'm sorry but there's no way the FBI will publically admit they are unable to break strong encryption on many consumer devices. Uhhh, yeah they would. In order to get the key escrow systems they desire. Strong crypto works. If they had a way to break it, **EVERY** conviction in cases involving strong crypto would be proof of their ability. They're not going to get their back doors by staying silent.&gt;The only possible explanation for this public confession is to give people a false sense of security.This is delusional. If they already had the ability, keeping quiet about it is the ONLY smart move. Drawing attention to the matter only tips their hand.	
3313	 pil4trees	 Sure, because having a capability without everyone knowing it is not valuable. You seriously believe all intelligence agencies broadcast all infosec capabilities? Or can your mind not comprehend  any other motive these statements could be driving towards?	
3314	 eatabagofbooger	 "The FBI supports strong encryption and information security broadly, Wray said, but described the current status quo as untenable."This sort of garbage is a real problem.

No. But when they *DON'T* have something the need, the *ONLY* way to get it is to keep asking. They're seeing a change in law that will force manufactures to do what they're **NOT** already doing.&gt;Or can your mind not comprehend any other motive these statements could be driving towards?Neither you nor I have ***ANY*** knowledge of their motives. We can only speculate. What we *DO* know, is that current algorithms are solid, some implementations may be vulnerable, and when properly implemented, they can't get into it. If they could, we'd have seen MANY more convictions where crypto played a role. Right now it's a hinderance to them. Don't let the FACTS of the matter get in the way of your paranoia though. You keep on believing things you have **ZERO** proof for.	
3318	 IUpvoteUsernames	 I wish I could encrypt my phone, but every time I do, the encryption inevitably fails and I have to factory reset it. Instead, I keep everything on it either backed up to the Cloud (Dropbox or Google Drive) or is disposable information. I am not lucky with technology.

3320	 LiftsEatsSleeps	 But, when things are illegal for the general public there is typically an exception for three letter agencies. Like controlled substance possession.

3322	 bdougherty	 &gt; It also accused the company of ignoring internet standards, which say that a cookie should remain on a computer until it expires naturally or is manually removed by a user.The thing that annoys me most is the attitude that they should be allowed to dictate what is stored on my computer without my permission (and no, visiting a website is not giving permission).Also, this is just completely wrong anyway. Relevant things from RFC6265:* A user agent MAY ignore a received cookie in its entirety.* At any time, the user agent MAY "remove excess cookies" from the   cookie store if the number of cookies sharing a domain field exceeds   some implementation-defined upper bound (such as 50 cookies).* At any time, the user agent MAY "remove excess cookies" from the   cookie store if the cookie store exceeds some predetermined upper   bound (such as 3000 cookies).That second item sounds to me like it defines exactly what ITP is doing.

Without adding any barriers to implementing encryption, unless they plan to also outlaw computers, the bad guys will keep on doing their thing. And it will be open season on law abiding US citizens and industry. Do these people just circlejerk in their brainstorming sessions or does anyone actually bring up opposing perspectives before they publicly take a stance like this?

3384	 exmachinalibertas	 Yes, the key exchange methods are what break with QC.  Symmetric crypto -- the actual encryption itself -- is slightly weakened, but mostly fine.  But QC hard key exchanges are being worked on, and we already have ones we know work just as well.  QM provides a way to prove whether or not data was intercepted/eavesdropped on in transit.  So you can just keep sending keys and just use the first one that was not intercepted.That's not any neat mathematical trick like current key exchange methods, but in practice, it works just as well.  After all, currently, an adversary has those same two choices in the pre-QC world:  he can either let you communicate securely (because he can't break the crypto), or he can break your connection.  In the post-QC world, he can..... either not intercept the key (thus letting you communicate securely), or he can block the connection (by alerting you to the fact that he's eavesdropping, which makes you not attempt communication).  So even though the methodology is a bit different, the practical result is exactly the same.Quantum computing really doesn't change the landscape nearly as much as you think it does with regards to encryption.  At least, technically speaking.  In practice, we'd need to upgrade everything to use the new methods, and develop a new infrastructure.  But all of that is already in the works because we are anticipating the post-QC world.	
3385	 ThoughtsAndLove	 That still leaves the content though, and possible IP tracking. You want to overwrite things, since when Reddit's servers update any old versions are deleted (there's still third-party caches, but it's something). Reddit deleters are supposed to be overwriters that remove the content.	
3386	 Cansurfer	 &gt; It also accused the company of ignoring internet standards, which say that a cookie should remain on a computer until it expires naturally or is manually removed by a user.Oh boo-hoo.  A), Ad-trackers have been exploiting cookies for a purpose for which was not intended by "internet standards". The purpose of a cookie was to maintain session to session data for a specific website that a person might wish to visit. Not to be used as an invasive, intrusive, tracking shackle.  B) Standards evolve and change.  	
3387	 BuckyDuster	 Encryption that is breakable is useless 	
3388	 exmachinalibertas	 The general rule of thumb is that QC cuts the key bit length in half for symmetric crypto.  So AES 128 would have roughly what we currently consider to be 64-bit security, and AES 256 would have what we currently approximate as 128 bit security.  So AES 256 would still likely be OK (for now.)  But AES 128 would be weak enough that I'd consider it broken.	
3389	 VICGUY	 FBI just created an new Oxymoron... "Breakable Encryption" Kind of defeats the purpose guys.	
3390	 elvenrunelord	 Then its time it gets crammed down their throats	
3391	 yetanothermember	 With a password manager you can use a unique, very long and secure password on each website which is a great practice as one website may fall under an attack and compromise a unique password used for all.A password manager encrypts the data and needs a secure password to open it. So make sure that no one can access this file. Make regularly a copy of it in a safe place in case the original file gets corrupted. Set a strong password to protect the password manager. A web service will not allow too many attempts to login which prevent an attacker to try every possibility. If the attacker gets the file he can try as many times as he wants.Another good practice is to write a different sentence for every service you need a password for. A sentence is very long, difficult to guess, easier to remember and faster than random password to type (or copy paste from a password manager).A password manager is anyway not a bad solution especially to avoid having one simple password. A long password to protect the password manager will anyway require weeks, months or years to unlock it.A centralized password manager may be useful if two people in an organization have to access a same web service such as a page on a social. media.	
3392	 Cansurfer	 That is AGAIN, talking about Shor's algorithm which solves things like RSA factoring in sqrt time (half key length). That's not true of symmetric algorithms like AES.	
3393	 exmachinalibertas	 These people just don't understand the difference between the physical world and the digital world.  The fact that they can open any lock in the physical world is a byproduct of the fact that physical security does not depend solely on locks.  Physical security benefits from the fact that it's *physical*.  Somebody has to be there.  Which limits both how often attacks can happen and how many can happen at once.  Only one guy can rob one bank at any given time.  So the bank door needs to be hard enough to break into for that threat.  But online, one guy can rob one million banks at the same time and do it in an instant.  There's no physical or time limitations that mitigate digital attacks.  The "lock" on the door *is all there is*.  So that lock needs to be unbreakable, because it's the only protection there is.These people just don't get that digital security is fundamentally different than physical security.  I have a strong password for my e-mail, but I have a shitty password for my home wifi router.  Why?  Because the entire world is trying to hack my e-mail all the time, but only a handful of my neighbors can connect to my wifi.  The physical aspects of my router are where the majority of the protection comes from.

3397	 Darth_waiter2	 &gt; Although, you'd think the FBI especially would have a vested interest in American companies having unassailable encryption on their trade secrets. It's the FBI that investigates most corporate espionage cases, right?Context is very important when it comes to corporate espionage cases, because it's simply too easy to assume an insider threat than it is to question if the corporation is doing something shitty to the employee and hiding it well. It's also easier to blame the employee than the corporation because the employee can't fight back like the corporation can with its army of lawyers at its disposal, even if the employee was thrown under the bus by management of that employee's corporation. Of course, an employee who simply wants to work and pay bills and build their career wouldn't do anything like that. The paranoia that still exists doesn't help anyone but increase costs everywhere.	
3398	 geheimnisse	 Please enlighten me! Why do you not want to continue this, from a privacy-centric point of view?	
3399	 Darth_waiter2	 I don't understand why people are automatically considered criminal if they are using strong encryption, or encryption at all? What if they were new to the cyber security field, and were testing encryption technologies to learn more about them and grow in the field, but perhaps they went about it in a way that caused suspicion, however that doesn't automatically make them a criminal to be using encryption. It's crazy how these assumptions are made.  With this kind of mentality, we can assume privacy will be illegal in a few decades or if not sooner. Time to short tech stocks in the long run if you've got that kind of money.	
3400	 Darth_waiter2	 ~~Does encryption even matter now with Spectre and Meltdown? And probably many other unknown vulnerabilities out there?~~Edit: I realized how stupid my original question about privacy sounds about. To clarify, if vulnerabilities like Spectre and Meltdown and more being discovered over time, what role does encryption play here if, eventually, almost anything/everything can be accessed by exploiting these vulns and computer manufacturers either purposefully don't disclose them in time or fix them/etc? And, how does that impact society as a whole?

3436	 erktheerk	 Because they have already pwned the hardware. Impossible to encrypt something completely if your hardware is compromised. Call me paranoid, but I have been on this topic for over 20 years now. The NSA has back doors, hacks, viruses, malware, exploits, zero days (whatever you want to call it), they don't want anyone to know about. The back bone of their process is allowing these to continue to exist in the wild. They implant their code anywhere they can. If one backdoor gets patched, they already have alternatives. They are the god hackers of the internet. The vacuum up everything possible.  Know how the F.B.I. has brought several tech cases to court trying to get the companies to comply legally with providing evidence? The NSA already had that shit. They just can't use it in court like other agencies need to nor would they want to. They defiantly don't want to share that information with others either. It would be shooting themselves in the foot to openly admit it.They operate on a different level. If you catch the attention of a human being from the NSA, you're already fucked.

3448	 lethalmanhole	 Speaking as someone who has no real programming experience (because I'm a mechanical engineer, but I do know how to use computers fairly well), I think one of the biggest problems is that programmers are making their programs too complicated. The fewer moving parts there are (read: fewer lines of code), the fewer things there are to go wrong. When there are a lot of parts there is a lot more room for error.I don't know too much about these things though. 	
3449	 blackomegax	 People who annoy governments tend to kill themselves, isn't that strange? Both founders of the same thing both committed suicide?	
3450	 SrGrimey	 Oh that's nice!! Really nice!!	
3451	 In_Sane_Plight	 Sorry about that fuzzy coherence element...I'd meant to point out that I'm in agreeance with what you'd said.	
3452	 causa-sui	 Okay, I looked it up. I'm not sure how this affects the use-case I described above. Can you help me understand what impact forensic equipment would have on a factory reset phone?	
3453	 blackomegax	 Don't forget https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hastings_(journalist)#Controversy_over_alleged_foul_play	
3454	 TechnoBagels	 what does this have to do with the customs employee not having Top Secret Clearance?	
3455	 panda_party1	 I can't remember the source.  But I remember seeing the FBI isn't interested so much in breaking the encryption as they want to pressure the NSA to hand data and techniques over to them.  The NSA doesn't want to though because the FBI will use it in court and once that happens their methods are useless.  Seems plausible to me but I don't know enough to comment intelligently on it, just regurgitating the info.	
3456	 easytraveling	 The FBI's statements clearly show a **lack of fundamental understanding of communication via the Internet.** Next step is to make it **mandatory** to place FBiI-Certified bugging devices **in EVERY home** .... because after all, terrorists **could possibly use personal homes** to communicate and gather in.  	
3457	 LastUserNameDrowned	 I'll definitely check out "Data and Goliath"If you're ever interested, the movie adaptation of "The Informant!" is very good, as long as you're a fan of Steven Soderbergh's style as a director, and will take up much less of your time than reading the book.	
3458	 ManOfCactus	 Wasn't there a post from Kim DotCom saying that Mega is now under some shady Chinese guys? Could be mistaken, correct me if I'm wrong	
3459	 svnpenn	 yeah, it was. the behavior i described before hasnt changed. in fact new page is worse because the "direct link" button has been removed. good game	
3460	 SirFerrett	 Apple is good for privacyDon’t listen to what other people on this sub will say otherwise 	
3461	 crystalhour	 Veterans are "investigated" ad infinitum because of supposedly elevated risks for "radicalism." Add that he was a co-creator of SecureDrop, and that probably put him at a very high threat level according to the DHS. He was investigated to death, just like Aaron Swartz. This stuff is all practically out in the open, and yet even on most forums of real credit it's hard to find people who are receptive to hearing this truth. 	
3462	 Airskycloudface	 this is why you study history	
3463	 Darth_waiter2	 &gt; The fewer moving parts there are (read: fewer lines of code), the few things there are to go wrong. When there are a lot of parts there is a lot more room for error.Coming from QA in Software I totally agree, also, people who test don't have a strong understanding of security, so they might pass a feature that works well functionally but is a disaster in terms of security and not know it. Then it gets pushed to production and there we have a security hole that was not tested. Its unfortunate but it does happen.	
3464	 Darth_waiter2	 &gt; I'll definitely check out "Data and Goliath"&gt; &gt; If you're ever interested, the movie adaptation of "The Informant!" is very good, as long as you're a fan of Steven Soderbergh's style as a director, and will take up much less of your time than reading the book.Having ADHD sucks because I am interested in too many things and not enough time to do them all while I still have other priorities. Thanks for the suggestion, maybe if you can give me a TLDR version of it will be great. I am not going to pursue anything that will make me paranoid for no reason. It's more important to have a balance of privacy and security and do research along the way in hopes that my career prospects get better. 	
3465	 ProGamerGov	 &gt; took his own life over the holidays&gt; We don’t know why James took his own life; we do know, however, he long suffered from PTSD from his time serving in the Marines during the Iraq War.It does sound like a legitimate suicide. But it's really unfortunate considering all the things he still could have done to help the world be a better place. &gt; “holiday cheer amplifies loneliness and hopelessness in people who have lost loved ones, or who have high expectations of renewed happiness during the holiday season, only to be disappointed”.Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_effects_on_suicide_rates	
3466	 In_Sane_Plight	 Right along with Aaron Swartz (as I was reminded from the "Killswitch" viewing).	
3467	 Harawaldr	 I don't mind you being wrong, that's ok. I'm wrong all the time as well. I do, however, mind when people are wrong while using caps lock. If you are unsure about what you are discussing, try to at least show some humility./u/exmachinalibertas is entirely correct in what they are saying. There are quantum algorithms applicable on symmetric encryption algorithms like AES as well. It's not Shor's algortithm, but [Grover's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) we are talking about. It's funny that the complexity you mention is that of Grover's, so it seems you've heard of it at some point. Shor's algorithm provides a significantly larger speedup at Õ( (log N)^2 ).

3473	 Conzerak	 seems more like the FBI chief is the "urgent public safety issue"	
3474	 LastUserNameDrowned	 I hear ya. It's a comedy starring Matt Damon based on the true story of [the guy who blew the whistle on the Archer Daniels Midland scam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Whitacre), directed by the guy who made "Oceans 11", "Out of Sight" and "Haywire". TLDR; here's the wiki: [The Informant!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Informant!)	
3475	 [deleted]	 well who's public key is this addressed to?	
3476	 [deleted]	 something very interesting is that most of these cryptocurrencies's encryptions are not quantum resistant. first party to get that power can prob collapse half the world economy. including all other financial institutions that probably are not resistant.	
3477	 merger3	 Well, vanilla iOS is better than vanilla Android for sure. For many of people, installing custom ROMs isn't a realistic option as it requires a fair amount of work.	
3478	 KopfKrieg	 I recommend Lenovos ThinkPads (T or X series). Or maybe a System76 laptop.	
3479	 proqsy	 The brand is pretty tarnished so that's on him, but technically we're on Mega 2.0, which is really MegaUpload 3.0. The old Mega is the one you're thinking of, lol	
3480	 nanoblast10	 I think that's the joke, maybe.	
3481	 [deleted]	 no, even if we had the public key we would not be able to acess it.	
3482	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
3483	 nanoblast10	 right	
3484	 DisillusionedReality	 If we have no privacy, they should have no privacy	
3485	 MRmandato	 Its a complex issue and both sides of very good points. Its not a matter of “doing your job better” for either law enforcement or the technology community. Law enforcement is facing critical barriers to prosecution that have never occurred with encryption and tech companies are under increasing pressure to stay one step ahead of hackers that would threaten the security of peoples most sensitive and valuable data.	
3486	 TibetanBowlHealing	 People said (and still say) the same thing about the Gray State director, but the recent documentary about his and his wife's progressive psychosis made a murder/suicide seem a lot more plausible. You never know what people are going through, especially if they seem paranoid about being pursued by the federal government.Obviously a "two shots to the back of the head" situation could not possibly be a suicide, but not every suicide is a "two shots to the back of the head" situation.	
3487	 dead10ck	 Yeah, but I imagine that's also because they actually employ security experts that know how stupid it is to complain about this.	
3488	 Cansurfer	 Interesting. I stand corrected. Didn't know that.https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/9480/assuming-a-1024qb-quantum-computer-how-long-to-brute-force-1024bit-rsa-256bitYou would however, need a quantum computer with a shade under 3,000 qubits, and it would need to be not just functional, but super-computing fast.  Current record is about 50?https://www.hpcwire.com/2017/12/18/world-record-quantum-computer-46-qubits-simulated/	
3489	 Secondsemblance	 Agreed, the arms race between cryptography and hardware is an urgent public safety issue. We need to future proof our encryption algorithms now. RSA and DSA should be deprecated everywhere in favor of elliptic curve cryptography, and we need to backport that to legacy systems. TLS 1.2 should be the minimum on all websites. Plaintext protocols like HTTP and FTP should be actively disincentivised by central governments.tl;dr he's halfway right, our encryption isn't good enough.	
3490	 eixxssxd	 Have had good luck with the Thinkpad T420 and T61/T61P with an Ubuntu variant, but am now scouring for possible meltdown and spectre immune atom based nettops. Had installed linux a long time ago on a N270 based ITX board. Hoping I'll have luck again during these grim times....Don't spend any new money on CPUs. We're at least two years away from the updated processors needed to fix this mess:(Everything you currently own must truly be thrown away.

3494	 nonbelligerentmoron	 I say we cut them a deal, prosecute every corrupt politician, and flay Clinton alive on the FBI headquarters lawn, then we will consider giving the FBI the access they desire	
3495	 DedifferentiatedLick	 Because the United States is definitely 100% capitalist (white men)...  yeah right if you can’t tell the system is increasingly more power hungry I don’t know what to tell you but this is not capitalism. It is every American’s job to limit the government’s power but we have failed to something called corruption. Basically the most powerful central body in our history at this point has oust us cleverly with monopolies we didn’t keep in check as a result of the people not remaining vigilant, so that turning point is what is leading to our downfall. Also please tell me more about the advantages of a non capitalist society. You and me both know it is not ideal but anarchy cannot exist in the real world so what is your answer? Pretty sure the constitution is pretty much void these days if you haven’t noticed. You probably haven’t got any nationalism left at all have ya? 	
3496	 _qghost	 Definitely ThinkPads. I have been running Ubuntu 16.10-17.10 on my L412 for about a year now with both Unity and GNOME, and it has been flawless (dare I say even more so than my desktop).	
3497	 Beestonian	 Hey buddy. You alright?	
3498	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Lot of thinkpad recommendations, but keep in mind that many have wireless cards that require proprietary closed source drivers and have proprietary UEFI implementations.To be fair, the UEFI has about as many features as a consumer can get. Thinkpads do work well with Linux- I had one for a long while and it was great- but you need to ask yourself whether you just want it *functional* or whether you want it *as open as possible.*You have closed source intel IME to deal with (or AMD PSP) with virtually every computer you get so keep that in mind too.	
3499	 Rubes2525	 &gt;pay a $200 transfer tax to ATF    "Don't worry guys, you are safe because mass shooters have to pay a $200 tax to get their special gun."    This is why I hate most forms of gun control. They slap on things that make no sense which only fucks over legitimate gun owners, does nothing to "protect" the public, and will exempt themselves of all those laws.	
3500	 Pr6Wq54FJKBhu	 a quantum computer just means even stronger encryption

3506	 smurfhunter99	 How the hell are we supposed to read that? lol	
3507	 Madenmann	 Aside from this FBI chief having many difficulties understanding the topic he's talking about i find it rather interesting to note the reason as to why people are bothering to read these news, as in, why is this in the news?People care about encryption and protecting their data.Aside from it being generally prudent to protect one's data, why are there seemingly more and more people trying to protect their data? It's not because of Isis or similar threats...	
3508	 TheToeTag	 I mean, He's not wrong. People will die due to the FBI not having access to encrypted communications. We just have to decided as a society if those deaths are worth our right privacy.I say yes, But sadly most people don't have the balls to say that they're willing to let people die for their own well being.	
3509	 ValenceJaxe	 Sure would be nice.	
3510	 ValenceJaxe	 History repeats itself and war never changes.	
3511	 easytraveling	 They're using a *multi-pronged* approach. Seems to be working well ;-) Edit: Anyone who doesn't use one (or more) of these *listening devices* in their home will automatically be put on the *suspect list* in **The Database** (i.e., if you're not in the Alexa/etc purchaser/user database, you must be up to no good &amp; therefore suspect).	
3512	 PenPar	 You raise a very good point. Encryption is only effective on a device that isn't already compromised by rootkits and other malware. Otherwise, encryption is bypassed entirely. This is why security, privacy and anonymity are all interlocked. Weaken one and you weaken the other two.I think privacy is important, which is why I think there needs to be a long discussion about the exploits you have mentioned, among others.	
3513	 claytonkb	 Precisely. The government has a hell of a lot more dirt to hide than the public does. I fully support opening *all books without exception*. "There is nothing concealed that will not be disclosed, or hidden that will not be made known. What you have said in the dark will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in the ear in the inner rooms will be proclaimed from the roofs." (Luke 12:2,3)	
3514	 KickMeElmo	 Well, to a point. -Different- encryption certainly. Kinda depends on how you define stronger.	
3515	 crankylinuxuser	 Using yet another bad translation of a bad religious book is no basis for rule of law.Im for transparency and proper documentation in all areas of government. Yet I don't need to break the 1st amendment to do so.	
3516	 stormaes	 Meltdown is the result of the problem of closed processor design. The other side of that problem is that there isn't a feasible open and auditable alternative.Intel still has its ME AMD still has its PSP. Until we have open processors available to the consumer market at a competitive price we will continue to have bugs like meltdown and spectre remain unpatched for years.I'm not saying the bugs will go away, but they will at least be discovered faster (and hopefully disclosed).The impact meltdown has on encryption is just that it seriously weakens our trust in ring 0. It only affects data that has been decrypted and resides in memory, and secure generation of keys. (granted, that blows everything up) 	
3517	 EinCB128	 Which HTC model do you use now? Thank you.	
3518	 gigavinyl	 Fascists go home	
3519	 KickMeElmo	 Keepass is entirely offline with no internet involvement whatsoever (other than update checks, which are not automatically installed), which by nature increases its security beyond most options. I highly recommend looking over the specifications yourself, but with widespread plugin support and (third-party) clients for just about every OS and platform around, I can't honestly recommend anything else.Security relies entirely on your choices. I have an encrypted read-only partition on my phone with around 5000 unique key files each named after a random dictionary word, all of them with identical access/creation times. One of those along with a very long password is required to access my database itself. I may implement OTP or a physical security key at a later date, but as of yet I don't use those. You can manually modify the file encryption algorithm and key derivation function, along with the number of transformations, at any time.Worth note, you can also store files, implement TOTP (authenticator 2FA codes), emulate pageant, and on keepass2android (my phone's app, which is open source as well) I can connect to my InputStick (USB dongle) via bluetooth (encrypted) to emulate a keyboard and input passwords in any device as needed.	
3520	 qemist	 So it shouldn't be illegal. No information should be illegal.	
3521	 NordicOhm	 Is buttercup a decent password manager? It looks a lot better than KeePassX which i was previously using, but i hated the interface, but i'm not so sure about how safe and secure this 'buttercup' app is 	
3522	 qemist	 The police are not an intelligence agency. Inspiring fear in the public serves their interests -- fear does much of the policing for them. They are  more likely to exaggerate their abilities than to minimize them (*you can run but you can't hide!*). NSA and CIA are two different kettles of fish.	
3523	 backupbettyl47	 Why not pencil and paper?  It's cumbersome to use, sure.  But if it's between two parties then it's mathamtically unbreakable.  But being pencil and paper, message authentication and key distribution are problems right?	
3524	 kanmw	 but how can we stop terror attacks on children if we can't access all your thoughts and dreams?	
3525	 kanmw	 why come you don't have a tattoo?	
3526	 backupbettyl47	 Idk... I don't think he's THAT stupid, at least I'd hope our officials are smart.  Wouldn't it be more likely that he thinks if he keeps going at it, the general population will cave in due to "going dark" fears and allow this to go through?	
3527	 backupbettyl47	 You'd might try using a liveUSB.  Depending on how experienced you are with Linux-based systems, it would go a long way.  I personally keep one on me when I go to use a public machine.  Just sit somewhere where the administration cannot see your screen, they might get worried.	
3528	 comebepc	 Sure. Anyone who isn't encrypting their devices is an urgent public safety issue	
3529	 comebepc	 The fourth amendment? What's that?-Not the FBI	
3530	 Geminii27	 "It's a (PR) issue that people trust proven mathematics more than a three-letter American federal government agency with an uneasy relationship with the public and a semi-sordid history."	
3531	 onewheel991	 Thanks for the info. 	
3532	 silverbluephoenix	 I moved to syncthing. So far the only hurdle I have is the android client cannot sync to external sd card, which seems super absurd. And does not have selective sync like Resilio, but I can live without that. Other than that seems like an obvious switch.The part that comforts me the most is also that its in the official arch repo, and not on the AUR.	
3533	 silverbluephoenix	 Syncthing misses selective sync, and cannot do sd cards on android. That is the only drawback I see so far.	
3534	 definitelydoesdrugs	 Great news, I hadn't seen this. Surely one more will flip, and having it just pass the Senate is a great way to keep momentum in the right direction.   This issue is not as cut and dry as the votes would make it appear. The public strongly suports net neutrality and it could very well be enough to slowly put Republican members of the House on the spot to the point where it's too politically toxic to vote against. Even a Trump veto isn't an undesireable outcome. He has a ton of support from young people who do in fact support net neutrailty, and taking a hard stance against it with a veto would definitely erode support from at least a certain portion of his base. 	
3535	 MeoMao555	 &gt; Rather outlawing encryption would just make everyone vulnerable except the intended targets - the bad guys. Ubiquitous mass surveillance of ordinary people is *the* goal. Bad guys are just an excuse. We should stop clinging to a belief that the government is acting in good faith, but somehow being misguided and not having the requisite brainstorming sessions. FBI is neither stupid nor uninformed. The government has shown their intentions many times over, and since Snowden leaks, it's impossible to ignore.	
3536	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
3537	 antonivs	 Yes, but effective organizations compensate for human weaknesses, whereas ineffective one compound them.	
3538	 faissaloo	 Only the methods used to acquire that information need be illegal, the information itself is legal (look at WikiLeaks for example)	
3539	 KickMeElmo	 Agreed on that point. Just trying to make the point that no agency will ever be perfect by any definition. These aren't magical beings. These are humans, with all the flaws. And in being human, they are by no means guaranteed to succeed in the goals we oppose, such as oppression and revocation of privacy.

3542	 qemist	 &gt; So you're fine with having your internet history, bank statements, medical records, etc free for everyone? What about the presidents daily schedule?That's where encryption comes in. It will protect your internet history, bank statements, medical records, etc and the president's schedule better than any law.	
3543	 idrequired220	 Installing lineage on a pixel is a bit of a pain but its definitely doable. Between Fdroid, Yalp Store, and Firefox you should be able to get by just fine. The experience is a little choppy at times but having some control over your own data feels pretty nice.	
3544	 AtBios	 This sounds interesting, so is this service now actually proper e2e and no longer so shady? Because I have been interested in them for a while, but when I search for it I always get some shady articles and such. 	
3545	 AtBios	 The only thing that scares me with Buttercup (or well scares me is actually a bit too strong of a word). Makes me hesitate is that it still hasn't had an audit. As soon as that is done, I would most likely move over as I think it looks and works great (from what I tested).  	
3546	 NordicOhm	 i hope it goes well anyway, already using that instead of KeePass. It is the best password manager i have ever used that doesn't rely on cloud or other companies	
3547	 AtBios	 Cool. As I wrote, I also like the parts I tested. :) Just always is a bit scared before an audit is made since I not techinal enough with my coding to understand all of it. :)Do you know to get auto filling to work in Firefox btw? I tried several different ways without any luck. 	
3548	 NordicOhm	 I have no clue how to enable that sorry mate, didn't even know that was a thing lol 	
3549	 stiofan_io	 Let's try to come up with a practical solution.We can start by banning the teaching of prime numbers. I think this is easy enough, we can just redefine numbers as starting with 4, followed by 6, 8, 9, etc.We should probably want to avoid teaching factorisation as well, so we would need to ban multiplication. This is no big deal though, as multiplication is just fancy addition.Finally, and I hope this doesn't come across as racist, I simply care about freedom and the safety of our children, but we should ban those fancy maths symbols like ∑ and ∏ as they look sort of Arabic.	
3550	 cBvOh76Zo2i9	 &gt;	consider that everything we believed about mass surveillance was once considered such as well, and THIS sort of thing is not a new MO for the intellegence community/deep stateNot a falsifiable view and as such liable to be dismissed out-of-hand.

3552	 Harawaldr	 Not arguing this will be achievable any time soon, but as QC technology matures it does mean we should be more conservative with our symmetric crypto as well. It just isn't as disrupting as the asymmetric case.

3559	 mxt79	 It's a holy mess. It integrates with google drive. Many of your files will end up being there twice, and you kind of loose half your hair trying to find out which one you can delete when backing up and cleaning out old unwanted photos. A copy of a photo is not always a copy but a link to the original file. This is especially annoying when you have edited a picture and that gets uploaded again with the same filename. Some photos only show up in Google photos, and others only show up under Google drive. Some photos show up both places and in the end it just gonna drive you crazy spending time looking through hundreds of pictures wondering where that specific photo went. There is no sane way of organising anything. Photos are also sometimes converted to lower quality.  And beside that they probably run their facial recognition algorithms on all photos that gets uploaded and it gets used for whatever weird social experiment you can imagine.    I think it is safe enough but the convenience of having a backup space like that in this case comes with certain disadvantages.. :(

3567	 commentator9876	 The gun analogy is terrible. The 2nd Amendment is useless. Despite the rhetoric from the useless, divisive morons at the NRA ("But muh Second Amendment"), it actually guarantees nothing.The Second Amendment makes no distinction in what constitutes "arms", yet did nothing to stop the 1986 prohibition on machine guns. It did nothing to prevent the Clinton-era Assault Weapon Ban. Can you own a fully functional tank? How about high explosives, or nuclear weapons?All of these are "arms", yet the second amendment has not prevented a subset of arms being banned.Following that precedent, it would be entirely possible for the government to consider that "arms" refers to the contemporary arms of 1791 and prohibit everything newer. Including Diffie-Helman and asymmetric encryption.The Second Amendment is a carrot that the US Government hangs in front of the NRA to distract them from actually doing any sensible or effective campaigning or making meritorious arguments. It has made them lazy, divisive and entitled, relaxing on the crutch of "muh 2nd Amendment" as though it is a magic staff which wins every argument, despite the fact that it demonstrably can be (and has been) kicked from under them whenever it suits Congress.What is far more powerful is the First Amendment, as used by Phil Zimmerman to make PGP available outside the US.

3584	 bobbyfiend	 They have things like Green Lantern (possibly outdated now?).And remember the FBI's trajectory since the good ol' days (e.g., when Scully and Mulder were at least vaguely plausible representations of Special Agents). Since 2001 the FBI has aggressively reallocated funds from pretty much everything else it does toward domestic terrorism investigations, not because of some rise in domestic terror incidents but because that's where the political money is. They've systematically starved every other program in their purview so they could prosecute "terrorists."That word is in quotes because now, almost two decades on, the FBI has very little to show for their efforts. They have an ugly string of failed prosecutions of alleged domestic terrorists, many of whom are believed by jury after jury to be entrapped, led by the nose by undercover FBI agents or by informants to do things they never would have done otherwise.So the FBI is feeling the heat. They dropped their steady gig and jumped on the Homeland Security train and that hasn't worked out for them very well. So of course they want yet  more unrestricted access to everything; in the Director's mind I'm sure that's the key to finding more domestic terrorists so their budget can begin growing at insane rates again.

Using a secret key only the administrator possesses to sign those invitations could let the admin prove his or her identity and prevent the spoofed invites, locking out uninvited guests. WhatsApp has yet to take their advice.&gt;Until they do, WhatsApp's most sensitive users should consider sticking with one-to-one conversations, or switching to a more secure group messaging app like Signal. Otherwise, they'd be wise to keep a vigilant eye out for any new entrants sliding into their private conversations. Until an administrator actively vouches for that newcomer, there's a small chance he or she might just be something other than a new friend.So no groupchat in whatsapp

3616	 FOSHavoc	 Signal is a silo like WhatsApp so it's vulnerable to the changing interests of the owners. Riot has its encryption in beta (at least on mobile) and even fewer people use or know about it than signal.I use WhatsApp, but I'd love it if all my contacts switched to riot. I don't see a benefit on switching to other silo messenger services even if they have better privacy or security as that all may just be temporary. Whatsapp got sold to Facebook and there was nothing anyone could do about it. All silo services suffer from this drawback.

Not to mention you're talking about a physical good that (until recently) was relatively expensive to mass produce, and even more expensive to produce in small quantities.Full disclosure. I'm not a fan of guns and if I could wish them all away, I would, but the reality is that there are a lot of guns out there, they're cheap, and as 3D printing evolves they'll become even cheaper and more widely available. We need reasonable controls that maximize public safety without leading to the "only bad guys have guns" situation. Especially if are the government becomes the "bad guys".	
3625	 PBinHtown	 Same thing happened to me. Very bizarre.	
3626	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 I'm really trying to switch to Riot, but it's a pain to get everything all set up with other services. I use Slack at work, Gitter with some open source projects, IRC with other open source projects, discord for gaming, singal as a replacement for Android's SMS, and Hangouts with my wife.Most of those have bridges in Riot, and I've tried setting it up, but it's a royal pain. IRC's easy, but we use lots of channels in Slack at work and I have to add each one manually, and my user shows up as a bot (I guess that's fine). I'm on 5 or so channels, so that means if I try to get my coworkers involved, I'll have to make 5 separate incoming webhooks or each person who wants to switch, and I'm not really sure how that works in rooms. This likely has to do with the "silo" type situation at Slack, but it's just hampering my adoption.As such, I haven't been able to switch to Riot. Once they ship Asterisk support, I'll try to switch from Signal and switch my number to VoIP, however I don't think I'll ever be able to fully commit to switching from Slack. I may able to live with Gitter and IRC integration and get my wife to switch from Hangouts, but Slack and Discord (I don't know of any bridges yet) seem right out.And that's really going to be a problem for Riot going forward IMO. Slack positioned itself as the business solution (my boss liked it because it seemed "business friendly" or whatever), Discord is entrenched for gamers (I'll try to get my crew to switch to Riot, but no promises there), though I suppose it could steal users from the other offerings.However, unless Riot in particular and Matrix generally can make integration with these services transparent, they're just yet another [competing standard](https://xkcd.com/927/). I want to like them because they're open source, but it's just not a transparent replacement and I don't want to go through the work to get people to switch (I did that already when switching from Google Chat, and Slack was the result).	
3627	 RaddiNet	 These deaths make me nervous, but still, this kind of tools and projects are more important today than ever.	
3628	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
3629	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 I only use Signal because it transparently replaces SMS and I can get my contacts to switch one at a time. I haven't done a huge push because I don't like how Signal doesn't really integrate with any other services, so I'm a bit more bullish on Riot.However, Riot doesn't allow me to replace traditional text messages (which I *need* for my job), so it's less switching and more adding yet another chat service. I already have several (Slack, Discord, Gitter, IRC, Google Hangouts), so until Riot can actually *replace* more than one *transparently* (meaning I and my contacts don't notice any significant difference), it's not worth my time to use Riot, because that requires getting my contacts to switch, which is very difficult.I'm *very* interested in Riot's Asterisk integration, which means I *should* be able to replace my dialer and SMS messenger with Riot by switching to VoIP, so once that happens, I may be able to put in the effort to integrate those other services. However, my primary messaging service is Slack (work), and the integration just isn't seamless at all (I need to configure a separate hook per channel, and I'm involved in a *lot* of channels).

3631	 Issachar	 WhatApps looks significantly better than Signal.  That's appearance not function, but appearance is important to people.  An ugly comfortable couch won't sell as well as an attractive comfortable couch.  People like things to look nice.This is a security risk but not one most people are going to care about particularly if it's true that participants are notified when anyone new is added.  That rules out routine mass surveillance of WhatsApp.Also, there's network effect issues.  A LOT of people use WhatsApp.  That itself is a common reason to use WhatsApp.

3645	 penguin-it	 I used to think just like you. But this model doesn't scale. There are multiple threats to users. And a lot of them come from switching to "install apps from unkown sources". This also threatens privacy. What Moxie is trying to accomplish is different from what you want. He wants to raise the bar in general. On a whole different scale. Moxie isn't thinking about enthusiasts using his service, but everyone. If my friends like WhatsApp better, because it has more features and is easier to use, I can't communicate with them via Signal. If my grandmother uses Signal from F-Droid, but then falls victim to a malicious app from a third party, because phone security is compromised, the communication is also compromised. Also my grandmother needs something easy to use.I can totally understand where you are coming from. I come from the very same place. But over the last three years I have come to appreciate where Moxie is coming from as well. And I think in the end, he is right. 	
3646	 Ayn-Randy_Savage	 And yet whenever I tell people that SAAS products are inherently insecure, they roll their eyes at me. You want security?

She would have to download an apk file from a website, then install it on her phone herself. All packages on F-Droid are signed by PGP. If you install an app outside of F-Droid (whether apk file or Play Store), you cannot update via F-Droid because PGP used to sign does not match.I find it more secure to use F-Droid than to have to download &amp; install it via Signal's website.&gt;Also my grandmother needs something easy to use.F-Droid works like Play Store but with A LOT less bloat, so it's definitely easy to use. And you can set it up to have automatic updates and instant installs (without having to confirm the install) too.I still don't agree with m0xie promoting the usage of Play Services in a privacy-oriented app. I am glad that it can use web sockets now if Play Services isn't installed (and if microG is disabled at first boot), but it was a long ongoing battle to get this.---**All-in-All: Signal being available in both Play Store &amp; F-Droid, without the need of Play Services works for everyone.**	
3651	 PrivacyNoob	 Ok, thanks :)	
3652	 JackDostoevsky	 WhatsApp encryption *is* Signal. They use OWS's tech to encrypt the WhatsApp network.Also, have fun convincing your friends to switch platforms. Maybe you'll have better luck than I, but throughout my life trying to get people (especially non-technical users who "have nothing to hide") to switch is a royal pain. It's why I (begrudgingly) still use Facebook Messenger on occasion (though I stick to secret chats).That's why it's so important that WhatsApp includes e2e encryption.	
3653	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
3654	 JackDostoevsky	 Nah. This doesn't break the encryption, it just gets around it. They just need to get clever with this.One-on-one conversations are still uncracked.	
3655	 JackDostoevsky	 I see what you're getting at but it's a little off. They *don't* have a key. It's more like... the mafia is able to crawl in through an open window in your *garage*, where you host parties of trusted friends, but they still can't get into your *house*. Technically they can't even unlock the garage; an open window is a security risk that can be fixed since there's no reason to replace the locks.

3657	 ReverendWilly	 (TL;DR: the keys are a form of payment)You say (/s) but isn't that why we don't trust private police? Mafia is a form of protection... If it wasn't compulsory, it would be seen as private police, right? So the answer is public service, but it needs to be funded by levying taxes (if we maintain a non-profit/non-wealthy government). If it was opt-in, everyone would opt-out of paying, so taxes end up compulsory.I think even in this sub, most people are not anarchists, and probably aren't mostly Republican, and when we say "small government" we don't mean cutting education funding, right?If government (mafia) served to protect and provide for citizens (including providing safety by way of mitigating damage from other citizens, e.g. laws against murder, et al), we would be fine to pay taxes. When those tax dollars also go to copy our house keys, they're no longer in the realm of service through tax dollars. The government still serves, but instead of compulsory monetary donations, they instate compulsory "Help us by sharing error messages and data on usage" clauses that grant them keys to my house.I'm fine paying taxes. Heck, I'd like my taxes to go up if it means improved quality of life for those around me in my neighborhood! But I want to keep taxes in the form of money only; that's the difference.

3659	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 &gt; WhatsApp encryption is SignalBut WhatsApp *isn't* Signal, meaning I can't use Signal to communicate with WhatsApp users. I *only* use Signal because it can handle SMS and encrypted chat at the same time, and as soon as Riot can handle that, I'm switching.As for friends, I think I can handle them. I refuse to use Facebook, so they've already given in to use something different when communicating with me. If something else comes up that's better (meaning they can use it with their other chat systems), then I can probably convince them to switch, though I may need to do a bit of the legwork in getting them up and running.It's good that WhatsApp does e2e encryption, but it's yet another chat service that I'd have to use, and it's owned by Facebook so I don't trust it. I want something open that can actually replace (e.g. wrap) other services I use. I'm happy to put in the legwork of convincing others to switch, but I need something to switch *to*.

3701	 trai_dep	 &gt;It was with an extremely heavy heart that we recently learned our friend and former colleague James Dolan—one of the co-creators of SecureDrop and Freedom of the Press Foundation’s first full time employee—took his own life over the holidays. He was 36.&gt;In 2012, James worked with Aaron Swartz and journalist Kevin Poulsen to build the original prototype of SecureDrop, the open source whistleblower submission system, which was then called DeadDrop…&gt;Beyond a couple references on our website, that New Yorker story is virtually all that is in the public domain about James’s involvement in the project—and that’s how he preferred it. James was an intensely private and modest person, and despite the fact the SecureDrop soon got a lot of attention when Freedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) took the project over, he constantly insisted that Aaron deserved all the credit.&gt;Yet SecureDrop would not currently exist without James, and he deserves all the commendation in the world for making it what it is today… It's very much worth reading Trevor Timm's moving eulogy in full.

3709	 Issachar	 &gt; That's bullshit. Never heard this from a grand developer. They say it when they write their application through the choices they make.Install an app.  Start it up.  Is it immediately "dark" the first time you open it?  No?  Then the developer has made it non-dark by default and that's their statement.Grab a bunch of apps at random and do that.  You'll find that most aren't dark the moment you open them.	
3710	 ilzxbuny	 Android user here. I use [Substratum](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=projekt.substratum) with the [Swift Black](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brit.swiftblack.layers) theme, and it creates a dark theme overlay for WhatsApp that works great.	
3711	 CaptainAnon	 &gt;If it was opt-in, everyone would opt-out of paying, so taxes end up compulsory.I agree, but AnCaps will point out that's a baseless assumption. Secondarily a government breaking into WhatsApp not only a tax on your privacy, but it's also facilitated by a monetary tax. If the monetary tax is cut then there's no way to levy the privacy tax. Unfortunately it's all in the name of justice and defense, so blocking this would require cutting their budgets as a whole.	
3712	 Nicenightforawalk01	 I read the transcripts to the fusion hearing earlier and the bloke mentions that telegram had been compromised either by Russians or someone else. I don't know  if that's rumour or its been fixed but if security people are saying that then something must have happened. 	
3713	 GunnisonCap	 There’s always the potential for diffusion of truth through rumors and untruths so who knows.  It has long been obvious that the tactical complaints by governments and politicians about E2E encryption were likely designed to ensure people believed them unbreakable and secure.

3716	 avxrie	 I guess running Windows on a VM in Linux would be more "secure"The reason being that Windows in a VM could become compromised only within the VM itself (including threats to your network as a possibility)And as we know, Linux is less likely to become comprised to threats such as malware or really anything (although it's possible)Running Linux in a VM on Windows is pretty redundant and useless.

3720	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
3721	 JeffersonsSpirit	 A Linux host/ Windows VM would definitely be more secure than the other way around. And beyond even security, you have to worry about privacy- who knows what spying Windows does on a Linux VM, whereas with Linux you can trust it not to spy.This next part is bordering on conspiratorial here but given Microsoft's downright nasty push for Windows 10 and given the general societal trend of malware and forced spying, I would go ahead and make sure the virtual machine is constrained by a Mandatory Access Control layer like SELinux or AppArmor.libvirt/qemu/kvm can auto-generate profiles for VMs that allow the bare minimum of access to the host filesystem (as well as a number of other protections i.e. ptrace restrictions etc). This could also protect the Linux host in the event that Windows is compromised by malware and becomes hostile to the system.I too support not allowing a network device for the Windows VM, but if you must use one you might consider enabling it only when necessary. You might also consider running a Linux VM solely for use as a gateway for the Windows VM and setup iptables to block all of Microsofts IPs, the IPs of third parties you don't trust, etc. This is easier than dealing with a router, and is much easier to adjust on the fly (literally just open the linux vm window, modify iptables, then iptables-restore your new rules). You could also use ufw instead of iptables directly; ufw attempts to make iptables easy, and it is indeed pretty painless to use.	
3722	 redditor_1234	 In a discussion about large groups in Signal, Joshua Lund said that improvements to group messaging are on their roadmap:* https://whispersystems.discoursehosting.net/t/how-many-members-can-be-added-in-a-group-and-number-of-groups-that-can-be-made/1567/5	
3723	 realmain	 You won't be allowed back into the states until they get access to your encrypted data I believe.	
3724	 crespo_modesto	 &gt; OSSWhat is that?	
3725	 yawkat	 Signals approach seems better for this. They also had a bug but it seems much more minor.	
3726	 Sibraxlis	  The article implies that's not happening unless I missed something	
3727	 realmain	 I suggest you to use GitLab too instead of GitHub. GitLab is open source, where as GitLab is proprietary. It works like GitLab, you don't need to self-host. It's really easy to migrate from GitHub to GitLab.	
3728	 yawkat	 To add functionality to the app that captures messages before encryption they'd have to push such an update to *all* users, no? Even if it's only selectively enabled.That sounds like a higher barrier than the standard "nsa wants to take a peek at that one chat" scenario. Definitely a good idea to have e2e crypto even when the app is closed.	
3729	 yawkat	 Signal does this sort of centralized and without the server being able to add members.	
3730	 yawkat	 [According to moxie](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16117487) telegram does no crypto at all for group chats	
3731	 yawkat	 Yet signal manages without the security issue.The magic of public key crypto allows us to do secure authentication communication over untrusted channels as long as we authenticated public keys once.	
3732	 ciabattabing16	 You are right, however, I think Signal requires a physical proximity phone to phone key exchange for ID validity to ensure against that type of attack. There's other ways of preventing it as well with various other products.My point was simply "researchers" found water is indeed wet...I didn't understand the point of the entire post. They found a type.of risk that exists for most comms platforms? What? 	
3733	 PrivacyNoob	 Really helpful, thank you!	
3734	 XTXm1x6qg7TM	 I've never understood why people thought a currency that publicly records all previous transactions you've made is "anonymous". PayPal is more private if I don't want a random person to know what i've purchased recently.	
3735	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 Yeah, but I don't have to like it. It seems to reward those with the biggest advertising budgets, not the best product.	
3736	 yawkat	 Signal does not require proximity for preventing this attack - it just requires it for *really* authenticating public keys. But you can do this once and it doesn't have to be before a possible attack to detect that attack. This is a problem with crypto in general, not group chats. They found an additional risk in whatsapp that is not necessary with the available tools.	
3737	 notyourreality	 Stop using Apple products.	
3738	 baldchow	 :)	
3739	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 I'm not saying that what you said is wrong, I'm just saying that Signal has features that WhatsApp doesn't (namely SMS integration AFAIK) *and* it's open source, unlike WhatsApp.It's cool that it uses the same protocol so I can review that portion of the service, but that doesn't make me want to use it since they still have access to metadata and I cannot review that aspect.It's certainly better than other options, but if we're pushing for something better, why not go all the way and push for something distributed and completely open?

3745	 PeacefulHavoc	 The article is too long and I read most of it, but this is what made me feel safe.&gt; Everyone in the group would see a message that a new member had joined, seemingly at the invitation of the unwitting administrator. If the administrator is watching closely, he or she could warn the group's intended members about the interloper and the spoofed invitation message.If that happened in a public group with people I don't know, I wouldn't care about the privacy of my messages as I wouldn't know/trust all of the participants anyway.

3775	 SuperEnergyDrink	 https://telegram.org/faq#q-so-how-do-you-encrypt-data&gt; Q: So how do you encrypt data?&gt; &gt; We support two layers of secure encryption. Server-client encryption is used in Cloud Chats (**private and group chats**), Secret Chats use an additional layer of client-client encryption. All data, regardless of type, is encrypted in the same way — be it text, media or files.&gt; &gt; Our encryption is based on 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. You can find more info in the Advanced FAQ.&gt; &gt; 	
3776	 dthvt	 "Server-client encryption" is TLS - it is not end-to-end and does not prevent Telegram from accessing the contents of the communication.Note that "Secret Chats" are end-to-end encrypted and would prevent Telegram from access the contents of chats, but are not supported for group chat.

3787	 PatCRafferty	 The no encryption thing was wrong, but they still don't offer end to end encryption on it, which means they could read your messages.As for the article being old, if you could point me to an article showing they changed the encryption method I'd be happy to read it.

3792	 precision_is_crucial	 I've been interested in the idea of a cooperative ISP, but a cooperative VPN also sounds interesting. Unfortunately, I don't really have the skill set to help build either of them. 	
3793	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 Yeah, that's exactly my experience. I think they're trying to do too much too quickly.All I want is something that can replace at least one service that I use. The low hanging fruit is to do exactly what Signal does and take over SMS (unencrypted, of course) and provide encrypted chat if both parties have a Matrix client. That's the only reason I use Signal, and I'd switch today if it were supported.Another use case is open source collaboration, which is currently strewn across IRC, gitter, and others. None of the projects I use are on Matrix. I'll have to play with the Riot integration with those services to see if it's workable, and if so, that's my in (the mobile gitter app sucks, so that's low hanging fruit).The last, and it seems they're working on it now, is VoIP integration. I currently use Google Fi because it allows me to use my number on my phone and from gmail. If Riot supports VoIP SMS and calls (unencrypted of course), then I can ditch Google Fi and get a data only plan (and hopefully buy something like the Librem 5). I don't make many calls or texts, so it would be a great fit.However, the first and last are the most important to me and they're not functional. They're in progress (and someone claimed it should be demo ready early this year IIRC), so perhaps I'll be able to really dig in soon, but that's just not the case yet.

The vegas shooter used an iphone SE which is A9 and has the secure enclave and 64 bit architecture and they cannot open it.  Not even Cellbrite.	
3813	 sting_12345	 So how did they catch people before these smartphones came about?  Let's try that out again, worked fine before. They just got spoiled and lazy with mass surveillance and don't want to work for it.  If they want to make a case on you they can with enough time and money but they want their cake and eat it too LOL.

3816	 australian_user	 https://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/DID1. You need to find a provider that offers it. 2. Some providers offer the service for free. Others charge. I pay $5 per year (USD 3.92, €3.28) for mine with MyNetFone. (MyNetFone is a public Australian company trading on the ASX.)3. You will need a SIP softphone or app to use a VoIP service.Once the softphone/app is registered, you can register with Signal. The SMS will fail then you can proceed with voice verification where the six digit code is read to you over the phone. I’m using a New Zealand landline number as my Signal number. 	
3817	 Replicant_Nexus7	 Last time I tried it said it needs Google Play Services to work...that's why I'm stuck with Telegram	
3818	 diTTT0	 A great way to get started is to read through and apply as many of the methods spelled out here: https://github.com/adilmajid/privacy-for-the-paranoidRemoving yourself in general is very tough to do.  I'd suggest going through your accounts and specfically finding and removing personal information first.  As you mentioned, some recommend plugging in false data for a while on places like FB, but that's really up to you.  If you weren't a huge FB user, suddenly plugging in a ton of new, weird information into their system would seem to raise suspicion to me.  Deleting the account is the best option - you can always be slightly evasive by plugging in a b.s. "reason" as to why you are deleting it when you deactivate the account - like "Made a new account, switching over to that one", if you feel like deleting it outright is suspicious.Just realize that switching over to a fully private Internet life takes time.  It is like a "digital detox" of sorts, where you need to tediously go through your old accounts and strip the personal info away.  BUT, it is worth it in the end.  Adopting the use of a password manager (and super strong passwords), TAILS, Tor, and I would also highly recommend ProtonMail, will alter the way that you use the Internet forever, and you will feel much more confident and free to explore the net without loads of your browsing habits being tracked.If you are serious about privacy, TAILS is the way to go.  I'd recommend getting it set up as you are stripping away all your old Internet profiles, getting used to it, and making it your go-to OS to boot to daily.  Don't make the mistake of only completing half the job.  Tediously go through ALL of your accounts, switch ALL the passwords into a password manager (use a pass generator too: https://lastpass.com/generatepassword.php), and then LEAVE your old Windows OS for TAILS, FOR GOOD.  Do it once, do it right, and you'll never go back.For TAILS with Tor, start here: https://tails.boum.org/getting_started/index.en.html

I'd suggest a more mainstream Linux distro like Ubuntu or Debian on the disk (you can setup the traffic to go through Tor manually). I personally prefer Debian (on which Tails is based on) because it's purely volunteer-driven without any sort of corporation behind it and also because they have a strong focus on security (all the CVEs related to Meltdown/Specter came in my mailbox the same day the embargo was lifted for example) and free/open software.

This is the first time we as a society have had access to 100% secure long distance communications. You don't see the potential security threats that could cause for the FBI, CIA, NSA, and every other intelligence agency in the world? They rely on open communications between targets to prevent attacks and to build cases. I mean, How on earth are they going to build a case around someone if every hit they ordered, ever deal they made, or every attack they planned was done through encrypted communications? It would be nearly impossible.

Yes, anyone can look at a wallet and see every transaction, current balance, etc. The privacy comes with not being able link that wallet to an individual. But a lot of people use wallets that *are* tied to them, so the anonymity goes out the window.

3841	 helixb	 Can anybody own whatsapp servers? Then that would be even more concerning.	
3842	 redditor_1234	 You don’t need Google Play Services (or OpenGApps or microG) in order to use Signal. The app will automatically fall back on a WebSocket connection if you register on a device that doesn't include Google Play Services. If you don’t have the Google Play Store on your phone, you can download the Signal Android APK directly from the official website:* https://signal.org/android/apk/If you first register on a device that includes Google Play Services and later decide to disable or remove Google Play Services, the app will display a notification complaining about the lack of Google Play Services. At that point, you just need to re-register and the app should fall back on the WebSocket connection. In order to re-register, go to Signal Settings -&gt; Advanced and toggle "Signal messages" off and then on.	
3843	 redditor_1234	 No, the same flaw does not exist in Signal. The researchers first published their findings [about five months ago](https://redd.it/6q5nob). The reason the WhatsApp vulnerability is now in the news is because the researchers presented their findings at the Real World Crypto conference. According to [their paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/713.pdf), Threema, Signal and WhatsApp all had different vulnerabilities. Here's a TL;DR of the vulnerability that was found in [Signal's group chat mechanism](https://signal.org/blog/private-groups/):An attacker can't gain access to past messages that were sent in a targeted Signal group chat, but they can read future messages after they've added themselves to the group. To add themselves to a group, an attacker needs to know the targeted group chat's 'group ID' and a current group member's identifier. Gaining access to a 'group ID' isn't that easy because they are end-to-end encrypted; the attacker would need to get it from the device of a current or former group member. Also, all members of the targeted group would be able to see that the attacker has joined the group before they are able to send the attacker any messages. Signal users are currently not able to remove other users from group chats, so they would have to abandon the group chat and start a new one if an uninvited user joins the group. Open Whisper Systems is now working on a new group management system for Signal, and Moxie Marlinspike has said that it "[should be deploying soon.](https://web-in-security.blogspot.com/2017/07/insecurities-of-whatsapps-signals-and.html)"	
3844	 australian_user	 That’s not true :)A few Australian providers accept BPay, which is compatible with Bitcoin via: https://www.livingroomofsatoshi.comThere’s also Load&amp;Go Visa cards that don’t require ID. I don’t know if that sort of thing is available in foreign countries. I can only share what’s worked for me to throw out some options. I know they’re not exactly straightforth options.  	
3845	 furquan_ahmad	 End-to-end as in Signal. Not sure what you mean by "whatsapp encryption" (it's also e2e as per the Signal protocol).	
3846	 EnigmaticZee	 I was being sarcastic about WhatsApp. It's really not encrypted. 	
3847	 GunnisonCap	 Telegram has full E2E encryption, way out of date but I appreciate the link and pointing out. It used to be leaky, I think it is better than most for privacy but defer to experts

3850	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
3851	 redditor_1234	 &gt;Telegram has full E2E encryption...No, Telegram does not have full end-to-end encryption. [It is marketed as a private messenger, but it's not private by default](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacytoolsIO/comments/6r655i/telegram_isnt_safe/). It collects all of its users' contact lists and every message, photo, video and document that they send in the default chat mode, and the app's default settings make it possible for anyone who can hijack a user's phone number or intercept their SMS messages to instantly have access to all of that user's cloud based data.Only Telegram's optional “secret chat” mode includes end-to-end encryption. The “secret chat” mode does not support group chats, there is no support for it in the official desktop client, and your friend has to be online for it to work. Sadly, the vast majority of people who know that there is an optional E2EE mode in Telegram [don't use it most of the time because the default experience is so much more "convenient"](https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2017/papers/84.pdf).If privacy is important to you, I would recommend using something else. [Wire](https://wire.com/en/) is an excellent alternative.

3859	 GunnisonCap	 Ok thanks appreciate that correction - it sounds like WhatsApp is more secure by default in which case!	
3860	 potatoclip	 That might be the case, but remember: there's also the potential for man-in-the middle attacks, because **by default** the setting that warns about such an attack is completely disabled. Like Matthew Green said&gt;If you build a system where everything comes down to trusting the server, you might as well dispense with all the complexity and forget about end-to-end encryptionThis is the second time WhatsApp has screwed up by deviating from Moxie's designs.	
3861	 potatoclip	 No see, WhatsApp servers are unhackable. They're running a custom NSA-FSB-GCHQ designed operating system that has virtually no zero days, and it's updates contain patches that address issues hackers haven't even thought of.My point with this sarcasm is, the server is a juicy target, and nothing more than a normal computer with normal OS that is at most up-to-date and slightly hardened. Any sophisticated hacker or nation state can compromise WhatsApp servers. We security experts just tend to ignore this fact due to it  being a hard problem to solve. So we just say "end-to-end encryption protects you even if the server is compromised". In the case of WhatsApp, that doesn't seem to be entirely the case since according to the news, the server can add rogue contacts to any group chat.

3864	 potatoclip	 Telegram is a company by Mark Zuckerberg of Russia that has access to all group chats and metadata, by default with no secure option.WhatsApp is a company owned by Mark Zuckerberg of US that has the ability to inject hostile contacts into poorly managed group conversations and to spy on metadata.Signal does not require Google, and Google would only have access to metadata in any case.With that in mind, it's stupid to think Telegram (that has the exact expectation of privacy that of standard Facebook chat) has a place in the world of secure messaging.	
3865	 LatticeCrypted	 No don't do that man, that's not worth losing a friend over.Just ask them to contact you through different ways and to keep your data out of the cloud.

3867	 MrAxlee	 Damn, what a pain. Sorry about that, been a while since I used cloud so I mis-remembered.	
3868	 potatoclip	 Matrix is tyranny of the majority. It's hard to change what people have agreed upon. It's hard to get everyone to update every client when new features / security fixes are introduced. Development is slow. End-to-end encryption in Riot is still at baby steps. I don't see why Signal would be temporary. It's not like they do it for the money. Moxie has more money than he can spend and the actual security community has strong interest in funding, auditing and developing Signal.	
3869	 Rubes2525	 Exactly my point. It's all TSA-esque security theatre bullshit. Banning certain "scary" guns and accessories and forcing people to buy them back with tax stamps is just pure extortion on innocent 2nd amendment supporters.	
3870	 torku	 How about with the use of aliases? ProtonMail for example gives five aliases. So one could be a pseudo name as the master login, a second could be your real name, and the other three could be reserved for any purposes you want. Is there any danger with having your real identity tied to a pseudonym via ProtonMail account? The only people who would know are you, ProtonMail staff if they looked and anyone who hacked the account. 	
3871	 potatoclip	 Telegram does not have optional secret chat mode for group messages. Group messages on Telegram are therefore **always** insecure.	
3872	 potatoclip	 That means they haven't implemented end-to-end encryption for group chats despite developing the app for three years after the first complaint.	
3873	 potatoclip	 This is a discovery and does not have anything to do with WhatsApp's MITM problem due to unsafe default settings.	
3874	 potatoclip	 You can call your friend and exchange the base 10 safety number verbally. After that, you can increase the assurance by scanning the QR-code once, when you meet with the contact.	
3875	 potatoclip	 See [FUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt).	
3876	 wordserious	 Can I generate my own keys or cert on my own hardware, while offline? Did I exchange them in person with my correspondents through a secure means? If any of your answers to these questions is "no," then you can't really trust your cryptography.	
3877	 potatoclip	 A significant problem with previous group members of the chat being able to add e.g. feds to group chat was also discovered in Signal, that is FOSS. Free software is a requirement, but it does not fix the issue of bad design. (Although one could argue copyleft license allows you to fix bugs found in e.g. unmaintained software -- TrueCrypt comes to mind).

3880	 potatoclip	 It's not just designed by someone who's not an expert, it's also [not semantically secure](https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1177.pdf).	
3881	 potatoclip	 I recently spent a lot of time figuring out the best experience for private note taking on my computers running Ubuntu:[QOwnNotes](http://www.qownnotes.org/) is currently hands down the best solution for taking notes during classes / when reading books. It has easy layout creation and customatization. It has tags, note folder hierarchy, allows relatively easy management with bullet points, uses markdown and you can just paste images in the document. [Zim](http://zim-wiki.org/) was a good second option, and had most of the features above, plus IIRC slightly better bullet point indentation handling experience with tab/shift+tab.For Linux users, the best way to sync note directory between computers is with [Unison](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/) that allows one-button synchronization over SSH. [Great SSH setup/hardnening guide here](https://stribika.github.io/2015/01/04/secure-secure-shell.html). This removes client-side encryption problems one usually faces with cloud-based services. It's also faster. I noticed at times you need to resolve merge conflicts between different versions of computers. For that, I found [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/) the best tool.When reading papers or other PDFs [Okular](https://okular.kde.org/) has a fantastic selection tool that copies an image to clip board, from where it can then be easily pasted amidst my notes.Together these apps now form the core of my study techniquie. I highly recommend everyone tries the combo. The final tip for when cramming up books is the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Timer [here](https://tomato-timer.com/).

3883	 frenchmontanatheman	 Palemoon is Questionable. Adnauseum, an addon which auto clicks advertisement while also blocking it has been blocked by Palemoon, which in turn means, to install it you have to enable insecure addon installs.Otherwise they seem rather cocky about security, claiming to have fixed meltdown/spectre in 2016, (a dev of it on IRC claimed so..)..

You *can* make Android more private by using Lineage and no GAPPS/Google services, but it's a lot more work and is only really possible on well supported lineage devices.  Oh and Apple has much much better hardware security than most (if not all) Android devices.

3917	 v2345	 I look at privacy as basically being axiomatic. If you want to invade it, you have the burden of proof to show why such an invasion would be good for me. The default (and correct) position is to not allow.The "examples" associated with "freedom of information" don't primarily seem to involve personal information, so they wouldn't be in opposition to privacy.&gt;I've seen many privacy advocates push for piracy, removal of copyright, etc. Again, why? You should want restrictive control over information.I can think of at least a few reasons why copyright should be changed to be less restrictive, but copyright isn't really a privacy issue. If someone has made an unambiguous choice to release some piece of information to which copyright applies, then the release of that information is deliberate and intended.&gt;and have your leaked info instantly disappearIf a movie is leaked, the concern is loss of profit, not invasion of privacy.	
3918	 Amidza	 It doesn't. The fact that they know what is your password is pretty much the point. The guy explicitly says **what** password.

3936	 QuickIOS	 Hey you should!	
3937	 ZE1nhhfvnh91sFT3A98g	 https doesn't matter here. It's unencrypted when it reaches Twitter's servers. It's most likely stored in plaintext on Twitter servers.	
3938	 Issachar	 Well that depends on the feature.   ;-)But I agree.  My point was just that once you've got the basics of theming programmed, designing a new theme should be easier than fixing an encryption problem for instance.  Or maybe not.  I haven't programmed in years and I never really did it professionally.	
3939	 usr_bin_laden	 Nah, you can sniff the password at the request level. Yes, SSL protects it in transit, but the server has to decrypt it and view the password in text in order to perform the hashing.Sometimes this request data lands in log files too.	
3940	 ReverendWilly	 I don't know why you're downvoted; you're not wrong, and you cited a real source. Maybe you touched a nerve?Unrelated: mobile wikipedia looks pretty cool on desktop... took me a couple minutes to figure out that's what I was looking at!

3945	 maosredbrook	 Everyone has a bias. Subscribe to as many RSS feeds as you can and make your own judgment.As far as privately reading the news you have Tor Browser and RSS aggregation websites.I don't know if /u/tommymbargo still has anything to do with r/BitWars, but the concept of a newsletter over BitMessage sounded cool.	
3946	 subhuman1979	 Given that they still can't figure out how to monetize it, they could probably stand to shed a bit of traffic.	
3947	 avamk	 &gt; I did mean that!Great! :D&gt; and google any variation of "top privacy blogs" to see what i meanHaha I've actually never done that, I see!	
3948	 Throwaway_Apple125	 The only part that sticks out is the password part. If they're logging passwords in plaintext or have them stored anywhere in plaintext, they are opening up security holes. Nobody should be able to reverse engineer a password in a database.	
3949	 math_for_grownups	 I wonder if that means "which password", since twitter allows multiple different logins to the same account. 	
3950	 Paranoidsbible	 While some of these services claim to get info from records or whatever, most just leech information off other people search engines/databases. Opt-out of as many free ones as possible, especially those that offer you opt-outs through a simple form.Check here: https://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/infosecLook for "Opt out master list" and "paranoid's bible". Should help you find your info and whatever databases exist with your info. Did this a few years back, all that's left is info that isn't mine or false info I decided to leave up as trash data.It'll take up to a year for results to appear, however I noticed a lot of sites started to remove my info that I've yet to opt-out from, ergo they leech off of each other a lot.Don't know if that'd help. All I know is opt-out and push garbage data online to fudge their databases. You can also checkout "Uncle Daddy's Big Book of Deception". It has a chapter on using freebies to push garbage data out there for them to populate their databases with.

3956	 RonkerZ	 ~~I am in no way a security expert but I thought the hashing proces happens *before* it gets send to the server, so no password gets send as plaintext with or without secure connection. Not sure if it works the same way for twitter. ~~Thanks for explaining guys!	
3957	 theephie	 Does GDPR say something about actually, err, deleting, deleted data?	
3958	 seanprefect	 the only thing here that bothers me is that they can know passwords that means they're stored somewhere, that's a big security no-no like one of the biggest security no-no's around. They should be properly salted and hashed. 	
3959	 sonictt1	 I'm sure Twitter can do most of this, but given that the original source is Project Veritas, I'm saving my outrage.

3962	 MisterTheCookiePear	 Normally passwords are sent unhashed through the HTTPS connection, meaning the sysadmin can get to it, by dumping the process memory of the app server for example. Or when they do TLS offloading, by sniffing the traffic between the load balancer and the app server.	
3963	 SolFlorus	 This is non-news. This was originally posted on Project Veritas. You may remember them as the organization that tried to mislead the WaPo before getting absolutely humiliated. Project Veritas is known for editing videos to be misleading and is the epitome of *fake news*.Breakdown:&gt; We have full access to every single person's account, every single direct message, deleted direct messages, deleted tweets.They have a database and they regularly back it up.&gt; I can tell you who exactly logged in from where, what username and passwordThey log requests. The "what password" part is confusing and potentially concerning, but I'm assuming something was lost in distilling the information. Use a password manager to alleviate any concerns here.&gt; when they changed their passwordThis is a common field stored on the user object. It's often used to determine which users are affected by a hack or to comply with password rotation policies.	
3964	 MisterTheCookiePear	 Not on Reddit, or Twitter, or my bank, or Gmail.	
3965	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
3966	 ditditdoh	 A basic implementation of this defeats the point of hashing in the first place. If the client hashes the password, and the hashes are stored on the server, the hash effectively *is* the password and the passwords are stored in plain-text.	
3967	 ajax267	 If that were the case, the hash would be no different than a password. If an adversary acquires a hash via a breach, they would not need to know the unhashed password to log in to accounts because they could just send the hash.	
3968	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
3969	 ImpactStrafe	 Wait, what? On no "proper system" is the password sent unhashed. The server should never see the clear text password. It should never be exposed. It should be hashed client side and then sent over.	
3970	 15charisnoteno	 If you did this then the server is just comparing a supplied hash to a known hash, aka a supplied string to a known string, aka a plaintext password to a plaintext password. Hashing protects the storage of passwords, not the transmission. PS Always salt your hashes and use slow algos like bcrypt.	
3971	 [deleted]	 Not really haha, i'm just searching for real infos 	
3972	 BUSfromRUS	 I'm always annoyed by this argument. Yes, it does effectively become the password, but at least you're not sending over your actual precious password you probably use on all your important accounts. It's for peace of mind, not necessarily for security.Also, nobody is stopping you from hashing on both sides. [That's how LastPass does it](https://lastpass.com/support.php?cmd=showfaq&amp;id=1116). You can even add salt to it on the client side as well, if you make your salts predictable or give users the ability to get the client-side salt of any user (which is not a security concern).

3974	 TheHobbitsGiblets	 The browser will need permission to 'share your location'. If you deny it they won't be able to track you.	
3975	 v2345	 Maybe they shouldn't, not that it really matters as they can change the password anyway. They can also choose how they are hashed, or even hashed at all.	
3976	 Exaskryz	 Wait, what? Why?That sounds like an insecure practice to have multiple ways to enter... Unless they mean OAuth app stuff?Edit: Oh yeah, corporate accounts: https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7pojg8/twitter_security_engineer_what_we_can_do_is/dsj0kcj/	
3977	 v2345	 To the admins, the password isnt that valuable as they have access to everything anyway.	
3978	 sadman81	 NSA is like..."that's cute"...	
3979	 ImpactStrafe	 You are correct, but to everyone else it is. Hashing client side protects you from exposing the password if you got man in the middled. It means password leaks are harder  because they'd have to get the salt, and hash, etc. Lots of reasons other than admins can't see the PW.	
3980	 payl0ad	 What you think about is a Challenge/Response scheme, where only encrypted or hashed bytes hit the wire.	
3981	 Alenonimo	 I was willing to believe it, but then I saw this:&gt; **James O’Keefe**, journalist and president of **Project Veritas**, a non-profit organization whose goal, according to their official website, is “investigating and exposing corruption, dishonesty, self-dealing, waste, fraud, and other misconduct,” shared the video on Twitter. The snippet has already been shared thousands of times, and the full video is available on the organization’s official website.Project Veritas is a fraudulent news organization that keeps trying to put spies inside mainstream journals to make them look bad. They constantly edit videos to hide the truth and control the narrative.First they were involved with a documentary that tried to show Planned Parenthood as an evil organization that sells baby parts. Then they tried to fuck with ACORN, an association made to help people of low income, implying they were responsible for organized vote fraud. They also dressed as telephone repairmens and invaded senator Mary Landrieu's office. They also tried to make a video associating the NPR with the Muslim Brotherhood. Do you see a pattern here?Now there's Twitter, which is being constantly accused of harassment by right wing users, suddenly being accused of trampling everyone's privacy. I bet there's nothing outside of the ordinary and that they just managed to record and make a scary spoopy movie, for political reasons.	
3982	 Alenonimo	 Do they really? Project Veritas is known for being a bunch of lying hacks. If they managed to get access to a database, pretty sure they would count the row of encrypted passwords as they having access to them. :/	
3983	 v2345	 Your still not solving the looking over the shoulder issue. Line must be drawn somewhere. I think with SSL its pretty safe to send without hashing. If MITM became common, I guess that would change.	
3984	 dontsyncjustride	 you have no idea.. my project at work processes 1mil records/s. and we're small time compared to the nsa. i work for littlebrother, and we don't even cache most of the data we process. Big Brother terrifies me.

3990	 iwannaelroyyou	 My biggest concern with WhatsApp isn't "it's not really encrypted" It is e2e encryption. My problem is that it's Facebook owned and why would I trust Facebook with my privacy and control over my encrypted communications. They run on the data they can obtain from us, so IMO WhatsApp is probably another tool they use to get data on us and tell us they care about our security.

3994	 Tawse	 "Terrifying"? The only thing that's terrifying is that people don't understand that *every single system on the internet* is like this.  That's what you agreed to when you started using the system.  AT&amp;T employees can read all your texts. Facebook employees can read all your private messages. Twitter employees can read all your DMs.  How is this, in any way, a surprise?Hell, if you haven't set up encryption on your email client, half the morons at Comcast can read all of your juicy love letters, too.  *Edit:* Also, don't forget - Reddit recently admitted that every single letter going through the new chat system also goes to a third-party company, over which they have no control whatsoever. Don't want everyone to know it? Don't send it through the Internet.	
3995	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
3996	 VulgarTech	 &gt; The server should never see the clear text password. It should never be exposed. It should be hashed client side and then sent over.It's a good thing this isn't standard practice, otherwise every single website with a login would require JavaScript to be enabled. No thanks, I consider that a much higher threat than "Twitter might be able to find out my Twitter password."	
3997	 LifeLikeAndPoseable	 &gt;They say it when they write their application through the choices they make.But they did not make any choice. They just rolled with the stock default snow white battery drainer theme, which makes sense from the OEM perspective since it will degrade the battery faster. Thus utter lack of creativity. Moreover, if users were asked, they would prefer more theme options. And yet, Whatsapp aka facefuck does not care. And why should they? No real competition at this point of time. 	
3998	 BlueZarex	 Most places have very strict controls over who can see what and when. If you work at google as a sysdmin/sre , you can't see peoples gmail *no matter how hard you tried*. If your on the gmail dev team, you can't see peoples email *at all, no matter how hard you tried*. There are a very select few people who have the ability to actually inspect a gmail account or user and believe me, they aren't the sysadmins.

4002	 BlueZarex	 Jesus, did you look at thus story at all? Veritas makes no claims on hacking or access. They interviewed a security guy at twitter who made these claims. No matter how much project veritas is a bunch of hacks, they didn't do anything but record a twitter security engineer here, so there are no "false claims" or "hacking done by them. 	
4003	 BlueZarex	 In this case, its not like veritas made any outrageous claims. They recorded a twitter security engineer saying these things. 	
4004	 LifeLikeAndPoseable	 &gt;I have been trying to go over how this much information got out. People. Every person that processes your personal data can dispense it. &gt;Could this be part of that Equifax data breach or something?Were you associated with them? If so, of course! 	
4005	 Alenonimo	 Hashes, by nature, are just a fixed width piece of text string used to compare data. A small password and a giant 2GB file produces hashes of the same size and they can never be decrypted back to what it was. It works one-way only.Password systems use hashes because a server doesn't need to know the password to know if it's the same user. A hash works just as well. Enter the same password on the hash generator and it will always produce the same hash. Just compare what you get from the login to what's on the server.	
4006	 Shin_Ichi	 Is this supposed to be surprising? They run the servers...	
4007	 TheGoldenGoose8888	 If your stuck in Apple’s walled garden it is difficult. OmnoFocus offers zero knowledge end to end encryption but the data is not encrypted at rest. On the Mac you can use an encrypted DMG to store it securely at rest or an app called Espionage which I highly recommend for use in general. All that being said the iPhone will still be unencrypted at rest after first boot/authentication. Alternatively, look into TapForms. Its not a ToDo app but a database app like Bento. It encrypts the database and offers a plethora of secure sync options. It can easily be setup to do whatever you need and has a great interface. 	
4008	 nullops	 When you pay nothing for a service, expect nothing in terms of privacy. Even when you pay something, the support guys will have access to the info. It is like being upset that those in the hospital have your medical records.... well of course they do, they run the system. 	
4009	 MisterTheCookiePear	 Like I said, all of Twitter, Reddit, "my bank", Google and Facebook send the password unhashed through the HTTPS connection, and presumably run the hash algorithm on the server side. (I feel pretty safe in assuming they won't be storing plain text passwords in their databases.) They've done so since forever and still do, I just verified it on all of the websites I mentioned.You're free to double check it by pressing F12, selecting the network tab, making sure 'preserve log' is checked, and logging in to your choice of websites. One of the requests will contain your plain text password in the form data.	
4010	 bathrobehero	 ...which is no different than any other centralized website.	
4011	 Amidza	 &gt; In this case, its not like veritas made any outrageous claims. They recorded a twitter security engineer saying these things.Pretty much. I think O'Keefe is a cunt, but this is just a twitter security engineer saying this stuff, on camera.

If you're a security engineer, you'd *better* know how this stuff works and the information *should* be accessible to you.This isn't really a privacy overreach... why would someone freak out over this? When you work at a company and you handle sensitive data, you sign something at some point saying you'll never abuse this. Are we concerned about abuse of power? Because that's not exclusive to privacy and it's why people spend enormous amounts of energy hiring the right people, doing background checks, etc.What is the issue here?	
4023	 ComputerSnob	 Yeah, but if the CEO decides "let's just see this guy's email", you can't do anything about it. You're trusting him fully, you can't even know if they already checked your email.

Ironically, on Twitter. &lt;slowLOL&gt;. Yup. *That's* how quick the fake news industry manufactures, posts, then has an "objective second source" reposting their "story."

4026	 RobotsAndMore	 This might mean that the table keeps track of when each row (I think they use Cassandra still, so whatever Cassandra uses) is updated, it would know when you last changed your password. There is a decent reason for this, things like "You changed your password $x number of days ago", or if they are changing hashing algorithms and only updating accounts upon successful login rather than bulk updating all several hundred million accounts.	
4027	 Rafficer	 Sure. A mounted veracrypt volume works just like a normal usb drive.	
4028	 Issachar	 &gt; They just rolled with the stock default snow white battery drainer themeThat's a choice.&gt; which makes sense from the OEM perspective since it will degrade the battery faster.Rubbish.  Doing that also shortens the battery life before the battery is degraded, thus making the phone appear worse when it's brand new.  How long the battery lasts before it requires charging is selling feature.  Planned obsolescence makes sense.   Making your product worse *when it's brand new* makes none.************Look I get that you wish that more people preferred dark themes.But they don't..They like things bright and cheerful with lots of colours.   So developers cater to what most people want, not to what you want.	
4029	 onan	 Project Veritas still has an extremely clear track record of distorting, exaggerating, misinterpreting, miscontextualizing, and outright lying about what other people have said on camera. That is their whole deal.	
4030	 SubaruToyotaFan1986	 I was considering cryptocurrency then worried about the financial risks of it.As for the part about multiple accounts on the same IP address, how true is that?	
4031	 onan	 Right, and don't forget their most recent hit! They sent a woman to the Washington Post with a completely fabricated story about Roy Moore raping her as a child, in the hopes of getting it published and then being able to claim that therefore none of the other real stories about Moore's abuses could be trusted.And they were [hilariously thwarted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/a-woman-approached-the-post-with-dramatic--and-false--tale-about-roy-moore-sje-appears-to-be-part-of-undercover-sting-operation/2017/11/27/0c2e335a-cfb6-11e7-9d3a-bcbe2af58c3a_story.html) when the Post did, y'know, actual journalism and checked her story thoroughly enough to see that it was clearly bullshit.	
4032	 Kafke	 &gt;There's a difference between transparency for government/corporations and products vs. privacy for individuals. I fail to see how this is the case. Either restrictive access to information is good, or it's not. You're saying it is, I'm saying it's not. Once you convince me it's good, from there we can talk about who controls what information. That's the fundamental nature of copyright and intellectual property. Personal privacy falls under that as a subset.For example: Say you're a photographer. You take pictures of things and sell the photos. People then copy your photos and share them for free. This is allowed for your views? How is that different from someone taking pictures for personal use, and then sharing online, only to have others share them freely without your consent? These are identical in use. The only difference is whether someone is being paid. How does the lack of payments suddenly grant more privacy? I don't get it.If you think you're free to freely share information you acquire, how does that lead to privacy for others? Say someone shares something with you in private. Given you don't wish for information control, you are now free to share that wherever. That violates the other person's privacy. How is this desirable? Or do you agree that your views are contradictory and will never lead to satisfactory privacy *or* freedom of information?&gt;I believe in the power of the individual to choose what they are willing to shareIncluding the personal information of others? This is *directly* contradictory to privacy. They're opposites. You *must* restrict access to information if you want privacy.&gt; and I also believe the government has no right to hide cronyism, which is why we need Open Government. To be clear, I'm *NOT* advocating for private control over information. So I too am against this. It's wrong not because they aren't transparent, but because I support open and free information for all. That's necessarily an invasion of privacy. Hence the crux of my problem and why I post here today.&gt;These two issues are not mutually exclusive.Please explain how you have two contradictory models of information access. I don't get it.

4037	 sagaraliasjackie	 Ok so if the company has the hashes and the salts, there is no way for them to unlock the account without you giving the password? How then does a company access your account when there is a T&amp;C violation? But being sarcastic. Curious 	
4038	 themarketliberal	 Did anyone suspect that Twitter was storing certain E2E encrypted datapoints? Of course a web service can query their own database or have access to backups and logs.That said, if this bothers people and they begin to understand this is common, hopefully enough demand can encourage more privacy oriented services in the future.	
4039	 Kafke	 &gt;I look at privacy as basically being axiomatic. If you want to invade it, you have the burden of proof to show why such an invasion would be good for me.So it's alright if you share something privately with someone, and then they freely spread that around? Or if you enter a public space in which someone records you? Or track your purchases? These are not "invasions". They're just recording your actions in the public space, or sharing what information you gave them. Say, for example, someone has their house wired up for immediate sharing of everything. You then enter this house. Did they "invade your privacy"? What if they did not disclose this to you beforehand?&gt;The "examples" associated with "freedom of information" don't primarily seem to involve personal information, so they wouldn't be in opposition to privacy.Freedom of information in the personal realm would include things like biometrics, location tracking, media consumption habits, etc. I can make arguments for each of these that don't rely on societal flaws or appeals to emotion. Where is the line drawn and why? How do you determine it and control access to information?&gt;I can think of at least a few reasons why copyright should be changed to be less restrictive, but copyright isn't really a privacy issue. Copyright is *absolutely* a privacy issue. By default you own the copyright on your personal information. You can control what people do with it. Say: have it removed from facebook, or sue someone for posting it around. Without copyright, you lose control over your own personal data the second someone else has it. How on earth could that be considered privacy? Often I find the biggest 'flaw' in my privacy is the end recipient. Because I cannot control them, their machine, or their ability to share information.&gt;If someone has made an unambiguous choice to release some piece of information to which copyright applies, then the release of that information is deliberate and intended.So if you tell someone something, then they're free to share that everywhere with no consequence? How is that privacy? Why bother with encryption and secrecy if it's just going to be posted publicly anyway?&gt;If a movie is leaked, the concern is loss of profit, not invasion of privacy.No. It's still invasion of privacy. As the movie was intended as a means of communication between the company and you. And someone has now overheard the communication. For example, say the movie was just a direct message to *you*. They specifically talked to you, and had a conversation. Someone then records this and shares it around. How is that somehow different? It's not.

But generally, why would that be okay?&gt;Or if you enter a public space in which someone records you?Depends on how intrusive the recording is. There are privacy concerns in the public space, but less so as it isnt private. &gt;Or track your purchases? That will not be so easy with GDPR.&gt;These are not "invasions".Yes, they are.&gt;You then enter this house. Did they "invade your privacy"? What if they did not disclose this to you beforehand?Being informed about the surveillance is obviously necessary. If I'm not forced or esssentially required to enter, then my privacy is still being invaded, but at least I have a choice, so its not as bad.&gt;Freedom of information in the personal realm would include things like biometrics, location tracking, media consumption habits, etc.I don't think freedom of information and privacy are the same thing.&gt;Copyright is absolutely a privacy issue.You are trying to apply a law to something that requires a different law, and in most cases copyright is associated with works like movies, songs, books, etc. If someone wants to sell their work, there is no privacy issue.&gt;So if you tell someone something, then they're free to share that everywhere with no consequence?If I knew that the intention of this individual was to disseminate that information without restriction in terms of letting other people know about it, and I still freely share it, I have made a choice and there should be no problem.&gt;No. It's still invasion of privacy. As the movie was intended as a means of communication between the company and you. And someone has now overheard the communication.If the intention is that only a limited number of people have access, and the movie is not ever supposed to be released for "public consumption", then it seems there would be a privacy issue there.

I'm against censorship.The difference here is, these things have to do with restrictions on information that has already been published.Privacy is not about restricting access. That's already there, those who watch and those being watched are already different groups. It's about your information not going anywhere in the first place.&gt; But being icked out by it isn't an argument.Of course it's not. And I don't understand why do some argue from those positions. Personally, I don't care why you might want it or what your reaction could be, you won't have it. There's nothing that says you have a right to it if it's not something I'm willing to publish.

Nothing is perfect but seeing the GCHQ not be able to penetrate whatsapp to stop several terrorist attacks makes me just fine with using it for non SUPER critical things.  Threema and wickr are VERY secure, they will all work fine on domestic LE and even FBI/DEA.  If you are the target of nation state APT's then NONE of this will help you anyway so why get so pissy?  If the CIA/NSA want YOU they will get you one way or another. Unlimited time and money will guarantee you make a mistake somewhere else other than being obsessive about what apps to secure your texts/calls.  Fine just use signal and nothing else.  Done.  But I know from friends that work in the DIA that Threema, signal, wickr, wire, whatsapp are all unbreakable to them and it is very annoying and frustrating to them.  Telegram I have been told directly by them is garbage that has never ever been secure.  So take that as you will.  I trust my best friend who's been there for 22 years and regularly calls me from the office during work.  They have three computers and three phones on their desks.  One is Normal, one is Sensitive/Secret and the last is Top Secret/Eyes Only.  He usually calls when he's doing surveillance on cartel drug boats off the coast of mexico or columbia.  When he calls me he uses signal or threema always.  Same for texts.

4104	 Kafke	 &gt;Depends on the intention, and if I know of it, and what that something is. But generally, why would that be okay?Because if you're against copyright, you support that.&gt;Depends on how intrusive the recording is. There are privacy concerns in the public space, but less so as it isnt private. I'm confused. If you support privacy, you should be against recording in public spaces. Otherwise it'd be a violation of privacy to have your image and face appear in other peoples' videos and photographs that they spread without your permission. And yes, some of these videos and photographs are indeed to monitor the area. So you're okay with ditching privacy in these cases? Why care about the rest then if you're just going to let everything leak once you're somewhere else?&gt;That will not be so easy with GDPR.Purchases are already tracked though.&gt;Yes, they are.Not really. An invasion would be forcefully adding something to your body, or installing surveillance inside of your privately owned spaces.&gt;Being informed about the surveillance is obviously necessarySo now you're trying to dictate other peoples' actions? Are you against people being free to do as they please? What happened to privacy? Why can't they keep information about their home surveillance systems private? Why the sudden hypocrisy?&gt;If I'm not forced or esssentially required to enter,This would be a violation of freedom. You're not forced to do anything.&gt;I don't think freedom of information and privacy are the same thing.They're opposites. With more privacy, you have less freedom of information. With more freedom of information, you have less privacy.&gt;You are trying to apply a law to something that requires a different law, and in most cases copyright is associated with works like movies, songs, books, etc.It's the same thing: ownership over information. Either you believe that it's not a thing and thus all information is open to sharing. Or you believe it's a thing, and thus require restrictive controls on information in order to enforce it. These are opposite positions.&gt;If someone wants to sell their work, there is no privacy issue.If someone wants to tell something to someone, there is no privacy issue. It's literally the same thing: a transfer of information and knowledge.&gt;If I knew that the intention of this individual was to disseminate that information without restriction in terms of letting other people know about it, and I still freely share it, I have made a choice and there should be no problem.Your knowledge of their intentions is irrelevant. Either they are free to do what they want with the information, or you require restrictive controls over the information you've provided. You can't have it both ways.&gt;If the intention is that only a limited number of people have access, and the movie is not ever supposed to be released for "public consumption", then it seems there would be a privacy issue there.That's how it always is. Movies are only supposed to be viewed by people who have agreed with the movie producers to see it. The viewer's end required a transfer of money, and the movie maker's end required a transform of the movie. Information for cash.So then there seems there is a privacy issue here.	
4105	 BowserJewnior	 The fundamental premise of this article is full of shit. You can prune things from blockchains just like you can delete things from a server. Sure, somebody could still choose to save those records, but that's an issue with them being public, not with them being on a blockchain (and anything on conventional cloud services is harvested by the NSA/FSB/3PLA too anyway).But data on a blockchain doesn't even necessarily have to be public. You can encrypt it just like you can encrypt data on cloud servers.The author of this article should inform themselves more about technical subjects before writing about them next time.	
4106	 Kafke	 &gt;The difference here is, these things have to do with restrictions on information that has already been published.So you'd be against government leaks? Does giving it to a single person count as "published"? Where's the lines here?&gt;Privacy is not about restricting access.That's exactly what it is. It's restricting others' access to information; whatever it may be.&gt;That's already there, those who watch and those being watched are already different groups.Indeed. And at the moment privacy is a thing as well. It's just not *perfect* privacy. Just like freedom of information is a thing, but it's not *perfect* freedom of information.&gt;It's about your information not going anywhere in the first place.And thus retaining exclusive control over it. Yes. say, for example, you tell someone something. They have this in their memory. To retain your perfect privacy, you must be able to erase it from their memory. At which point you are the sole accessor of the info again.Likewise, to "prevent it from getting out" requires similar levels of control. Take how you look. You can intentionally provide pictures of your self. You have 100% control over the images produced. However, once the picture is out, or someone else takes a pic (perhaps of something unrelated and you're in the background), you no longer have exclusive control. You have lost your privacy due to this lack of control. To regain it, you'd need to erase any extra copies that you don't control, and remove it from peoples' brains. The more control over the information you have, the better your privacy will be.&gt;There's nothing that says you have a right to it if it's not something I'm willing to publish.Yes, the privacy argument is that one deserves and should have exclusive control over information, and be able to restrict who can access it. I'm looking for reasons why this should be desired. I fail to see any arguments other than relating to flawed societies and appeals to emotion.

4118	 Kafke	 &gt;Information isn't actually free, nor is creative work of any kind.Information is free. It costs nothing to communicate an idea or to copy a file. As for creative work, I honestly don't give a damn about it, really.&gt;What you actually want is to steal the product of someone else's labor without fear of consequences,Not at all. I'm not stealing anything, nor do I advocate deprivation of access. Simply put: capitalism is a failed model and I reject it. It's holding humanity back at this point.&gt;robbing them of a livelihoodNot really part of the debate. You're arguing on societal flaws and appeals to emotion, which I explicitly said to avoid. Under my ideal society, there'd be no reason to require 100% employment, as such a thing is a fool's goal. But it's unrelated to the conversation anyway. If you think knowledge is somehow harmful to society, I say good riddance and that society *should* collapse then.&gt;because you somehow think it should be free.I indeed think information should be free. We have libraries explicitly for this purpose. Do you reject the idea of libraries? What about free knowledge repositories such as wikipedia (which has arguably killed the entire encyclopedia industry)? Are those okay? Or are those "stealing the product of someone elses' labor"?&gt;I have no problem with trading goods and services, but expecting others to simply give you their work is not ok. This is entirely unrelated to the conversation. At no point did I claim that someone should be prevented from doing business however they do it. The discussion here was meant to be on ideals and philosophy. We can extend a societal/economic/cultural model around whatever view we arrive at.As it stands, IMO, if a society cannot support the freedom of knowledge and information, then that society should collapse and die.If you care to make an actual argument, rather than accuse me of being a monster, then I'm all ears. But as I said, appeals to emotion won't work here, and societal flaws will be taken care of regardless of the outcome. So I'd like to avoid those two things for this discussion.

4181	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 &gt; Bad news if you're an American who values your privacy.&gt; A total of 256 members of the House of Representatives voted this morning to expand the government's surveillance powers, ignoring widespread support for reform.&gt; A roll call posted after the vote shows that breaks down to 191 Republicans and 65 Democrats.&gt; The vote came to a head after years of debate over the US' surveillance and intelligence-gathering capability, largely brought to light after the Edward Snowden disclosures in 2013. The so-called "crown jewels" of the intelligence community's powers, section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, are set to expire next week after an earlier deadline of December 31 was pushed back, forcing lawmakers to act to extend the National Security Agency's legal authority to spy on foreigners overseas.&gt; Section 702 allows the NSA to gather intelligence on foreigners overseas by collecting data from chokepoints where fiber optic cables owned by telecom giants enter the US.&gt; But the collection also incidentally sweeps up large amounts of data on countless Americans, who are constitutionally protected from warrantless surveillance. Event though section 702 explicitly prohibits the targeting of Americans, the intelligence community can then search those messages without a warrant.&gt; The vote Thursday marks the first time lawmakers have agreed to pass a bill since those intelligence leaks five years ago. Only one-third of the House voted -- unsuccessfully -- to reject the bill.&gt; House lawmakers had an opportunity to pass a sweeping reform amendment, supported by several civil liberties groups, which would've reined in the government's ability to spy on Americans without a court-approved warrant -- but that effort failed.&gt; The bill, as passed by the House, will extend the government's spying programs for six years with no substantial changes or privacy safeguards baked in. Some privacy organizations say the bill expands the NSA's surveillance by restarting the "about" collection (known as backdoor searches), which the agency was forced to shut down after it was found to violate the law.&gt; The American Civil Liberties Union called it a "dangerous" bill.&gt; Robyn Greene, policy counsel and government affairs lead at New America's Open Technology Institute, said it was "appalling that the House just voted to reauthorize it without any actual reforms."&gt; "The intelligence committee wrote a bill that bestows expanded surveillance authorities upon the NSA and FBI, and the House passed it and called it reform," she said. "This bill is worse than a clean reauthorization with a sunset and the Senate should reject this bill and demand real reform."&gt; There is a hint of good news. The bill still has to go to the Senate, where it's expected to be voted on by January 19. That said, the bill is expected to pass, though two senators, Rand Paul and Ron Wyden, have vowed to filibuster if no meaningful privacy measures are introduced.&gt; Dozens of privacy and civil liberties groups urged lawmakers in an open letter Wednesday to vote down the bill. Now, they say that lawmakers ignored widespread public support for reforming the law.&gt; The entire House is up for election later this year as part of the 2018 midterms, including the 256 members who voted down privacy measures that would protect Americans' privacy and constitutional rights.&gt; Here's the full list of congresspeople who voted to pass the bill, sans those who are retiring, just in case you want to vote against them later this year when they're up for re-election.	
4182	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 Well if you consider that a canvas fingerprint is the same across browsers, then yes, the fingerprint is the same regardless of what browser you use.https://browserleaks.com/canvas	
4183	 [deleted]	 I appreciate the answer! Is it possible to generate a new canvas? 	
4184	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 And here's the small bit of the article that talks about the dust (as mentioned in the click-bait title):&gt;  It might assume two people knew each other if the images they uploaded looked like they were titled in the same series of photos—IMG_4605739.jpg and IMG_4605742, for example—or if lens scratches or dust were detectable in the same spots on the photos, revealing the photos were taken by the same camera.The rest of the article discusses the 'People you may know' feature	
4185	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 There are ways to do that, yes, but it requires using different machines, or even different virtual machines with different graphics card configurations. Sure you will still be fingerprinted, but your identity is sharded across different machines so it would be tricky to tie all the various fingerprints back to you.When in doubt, disable Javascript as this stops a canvas fingerprint attack (Especially if you're doing anything sensitive). Or install a canvas blocker plugin.

4190	 Defender90	 What in the world is going on here?  I am very suspiscious of this "v2" project for several reasons:- The original project disappears on Github and the author declares on Twitter that he abandoned it...but it suddenly replaced by a new project written in Go.- The DNSCrypt website changed to a commercial company hawking an alternative solution for a little while...then went offline altogether.- There are several other Github accounts (dyne.org, and others) that are now claiming to be maintaining the old C version of dnscrypt-proxy.  This isn't necessarily suspicious--it's open source, after all--but who are these accounts and what is their reputation?Did the original author sell out or did he really just rewrite the thing and post it up without any Twitter announcement and while also killing the website?   Super fishy.I'm holding off installing DNSCrypt except from packages made before the original abandonment and I'm going to look at my DNS-over-TLS options.	
4191	 ondondil	 Signal is still an independent app. They just helped Microsoft implement [Signal Protocol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol) in Skype, that's all. WhatsApp, Facebook, Google use that protocol too. It doesn't mean that these companies exchange any data or share infrastructure.	
4192	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 &gt; Is the internet broken? And has the utopian 90s net been replaced by digital feudalism, where a few powerful entities wield control over all of us digital serfs? In this series, Jordan Erica Webber looks at internet-enabled dystopia, and how even the technology designed to do good can end up causing harm.&gt; To kick off, we explore whether our privacy has been compromised by the tech giants whose business models depend on harvesting and monetising our data. We speak to cyborg rights activist Aral Balkan; the executive director of UK charity Privacy International Gus Hosein; and to Kevin Kelly, founding executive editor of Wired magazine and author of The Inevitable: Understanding the 12 Technological Forces That Will Shape Our Future.	
4193	 BeurreDePinotte	 Yes it works flawlessly 	
4194	 distant_worlds	 The house of representatives is 100% up for re-election every two years.  If there's a member of the house that is NOT up for re-election, then something is very, very wrong.	
4195	 Rafficer	 Tor gets sponsored by the US govt. What does that mean to you now?	
4196	 FeatheryAsshole	 Meh. The Signal protocol is widely used because it's *good*. Having Signal partner with Microsoft to use it in Skype means the Signal devs have more resources for their own work.	
4197	 LatticeCrypted	 I can't explain your first point, but as far as the commercial company, that was sedo.com which is a domain selling service. Sometimes, when you disable your domain, domain registrars make it go to sedo.com, so that by itself shouldn't be a reason for concern. Maybe he changed his mind?Your third point about dyne.org, they just forked it, that's all.	
4198	 GrabAMonkey	 You didn't specify which platform you are asking about, but since you referred to Steam games, I assume that you are running on a Windows PC. On Windows, any desktop program you run, have full permission to read everything that you have access to. This means that they can potentially read all of your documents, watch all your pictures and videos, read the contents of your registry, read your contacts and run other programs on your computer. While installing their program, they have even more permissions, since their installer will most likely require administrative permissions. Their installer will be able to install software on your computer, including key loggers or network loggers, change passwords on all users on the computer, encrypt your folders or anything else you can do, when running as a computer administrator. Windows Store apps are a lot more restricted. They will have a very limited subset of permissions on your computer and you can define which permissions each app has, in your Windows settings app. They won't be able to install key loggers, change passwords for every user, install network sniffers or other malicious stuff.

4209	 redditor_1234	 To be clear, Microsoft is not getting involved in Signal's development. Signal's developers have said that [nothing about Signal itself is changing](https://twitter.com/signalapp/status/951595542206865409). They are just helping Microsoft implement the [Signal Protocol](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_Protocol) into an optional mode in Skype, which is called [Private Conversations](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_insiderms-skype_insnewsms/skype-insider-preview-private-conversations/01616ac9-2171-4151-b9a2-c77761c0fbf8).

4222	 mikbob	 I think it means that there is no password prompt for admin users? But for all other users this works	
4223	 LadyOzymandias	 Good point. Remembering how things are stored and available stresses me out. Like that Veritas article about how the admins and server engineers have access to everything you post or use online. Then remembered that they need that access for actual reasons, though it's unnerving to remember that there are people who can access and read those things you're trying to keep between you and someone else.At best, I think, one can hide oneself on the user end. Sure, they have all that info - but they can't link it to you. Someone posted xyz, but we can't trace where they are, or who they are, or much else about them besides some inane things on their profile/post history. That seems possible to do, with care.I unfortunately am writing this from a public computer that only uses Chrome. So fml.

4266	 peacewalker64	 I use Lineage with MicroG. I have two problems with Copperhead. First, it's not free software. It doesn't let you use it however you want. Secondly, the dev has stopped providing updates in the past because he's so concerned with piracy. There was a week or two at the end of November where downloads were pulled and no updates were released because some people were apparently selling CopperheadOS devices. I think it's stupid.I also don't know how Lineage with MicroG halfasses their updates. As far as I know, it's updated more often than upstream. LineageOS has weeklies and MicroG has semiweeklies.	
4267	 JustaReverseFridge	 Awesome, I'm kind of hesitant to use copperhead anyway despite how good it looks because I went into their sub and asked this question to the moderator, I think his name was strncat or something like that and he took 2 paragraphs to tell me that the difference was the lineage would open me up to security vulnerabilites but he took the most complicated possible words to say that.	
4268	 peacewalker64	 LineageOS officially has the stance that MicroG is insecure, but a lot of people think it's just because they don't wanna piss off Google.I love the idea of CopperheadOS, but for my needs, I require a better license than Creative Commons.

I have full disk encryption and every single app is in its own encrypted isolated container. Powerful software it deserves more publicity. 	
4276	 TheTalkingYam	 There are several ways to make sure you only view the old layout.  This, however, is in no way a relevant sub for this question or discussion.  	
4277	 Aerisnovant	 only use open source add-ons and hope that there's nothing in there that spys on you.	
4278	 Aerisnovant	 neither did I in the past, but now I do (i'm referring to creating new accounts)	
4279	 milibili	 What makes open source special? The fact that it is continuously reviewed by many proficient people?	
4280	 Peachlemonpotato	 Yes you are being targeted, change your Instagram password as well. And any accounts with similar/same password or connected to that email. They got you at the email so work from there. Use authy for 2FA	
4281	 ShitFrankReynoldsSay	 Well, like I said, I didn't create the IG account. The person somehow linked my email to it &amp; somehow was either able to confirm it, or IG is sending emails to me without verifying that it came from my acconut. I did find a link to try &amp; change the password anyway, but since this hacker already put up 2FA, any attempt I made failed. Fortunately I keep different passwords for every site I have an account with. 	
4282	 sting_12345	 apple 64 bit A8 and up phones like the 6s are EXTREMELY hard to break into even on like this.  The DEA and FBI are unable to do it, hence the 8000sitting in wait.  Somehow this german firm did it, I would like to know first though what OS the phone was using, what version and if it was updated to the most recent one or not because apple patched MANY holes in it's update to iOS 11.  I'm willing to bet he did not update it and thus they were able to get in the phone.  Though this is a guess adn I'm sure apple is on it now or already has fixed it.	
4283	 79cca0e8-d8ff-4ca9-9	 I disagree - as far as I can tell, new user profiles aren’t visible without logging in, which has pretty clear privacy implications.

4296	 cwood74	 Why would you want to hide the fact that you have a degree any employer or government position worth working for is going to want this. 	
4297	 emacsomancer	 I just checked in [Yalp](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.yeriomin.yalpstore/) and Spotify does indeed depend on Google Play Services, so you may want to install microG. Google Maps will also work with microG, and I use it from time to time, but I'm trying to mainly use OsmAnd~ for maps. Edit: for Spotify, maybe also look at this: https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/apps-games/mod-spotify-dogfood-ad-free-spotify-t3632423 ?

4315	 TrashMacNugget	 Reddit had an issue recently where someone could intercept verification and password reset emails. Maybe something similar is happening with Instagram, but I doubt it.	
4316	 TrashMacNugget	 They will let you sign up, but in my experience they will lock you out of your account after a bit and demand your phone number.	
4317	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
4318	 TrashMacNugget	 I've tried, but they won't let you no matter what you do, because their business model revolves around getting as much data about you as possible.I recommend using [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org) or [GNU social](https://gnu.io/social/try/) instead. They are part of a network called the fediverse where anyone can host a server and follow anyone from any server.

4325	 elbowian	 Not to be a pain, but -- I read the shorter follow-up which is 4 years old and recommends Ghostery (Ha Ha Ha) as the best defense against third parties. I question the relevance of this information.	
4326	 TrashMacNugget	 When I tried (maybe a year ago) it wouldn't accept any of the free services I tried. They may accept Google Voice, but that requires linking with a real phone number.	
4327	 r721	 Well, it's science, that's what they measured with their tools, but it looks like Ghostery is just marginally better than "Blocking all third-party cookies" browser option. There are other risks in using Ghostery, of course.	
4328	 singaporem	 Thanks	
4329	 ZopiloteMojado	 I read a post saying they got around that by using the text plus number to verify the Google acct and then used the Google acct to verify Twitter. Not sure if that works but worth a shot

4346	 P47_F1337	 The app freetone used to let you verify .but they recently changed their policy so you need a paid account to use sms/phone verification​.It can still work if you keep your app store account anon and use a prepaid credit card.  Also I have asked freetone for their legal policy, and was informed through email that they do not keep logs at all, and once a number is burned, it is gone forever. (not affiliated at all with freetone at all) ((really they are glitchy ad campaign))It seems that the reason social media sites ask to phone verify, is they log your ip and are alerted when there has been a change, prompting a verify. If you can use the same IP for each visit to the site, your chances of running into automated security software goes waaaaay down. 	
4347	 DannyDeVitoSLAP	 Are you saying 'conservative' values are better? I get it the far left does some pretty stupid nanny shit, but so does the right i.e. abortion, views on drug use, pushing religion etc..

4350	 pharos92	 That’s not necessarily true. Liberalism fundamentally is infused with the democratic ideal. All I’m saying is that just by campaigning for perceived socially progressive values (gay marriage etc) doesn’t make you a good person, ; especially while you’re blowing people up remotely and doing the banks bidding whilst going back on fundamental campaign promises such as whistleblower protection.

4353	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; Why is it so damn hard so create anonym social media accounts? Because social media companies make money by monetizing your data.

There are many levels of intrusiveness.&gt;Purchases are already tracked thoughWill not be so easy to keep doing with GDPR.&gt;Why can't they keep information about their home surveillance systems private?As long as it doesnt involve anybody other than them, they can.&gt;This would be a violation of freedom. You're not forced to do anything.Depends. If something is part of society, you might not have an option.&gt;They're opposites. With more privacy, you have less freedom of information. With more freedom of information, you have less privacy.Disagree. Private information can remain private. There is not one category if information.&gt;It's the same thing: ownership over information.Not really. The ownership would be important after something has been released. A right to privacy should ensure that it isn't released.&gt;If someone wants to tell something to someone, there is no privacy issue. It's literally the same thing: a transfer of information and knowledge.No. One is intended to be publicly released, another is intended to be kept private.&gt;Your knowledge of their intentions is irrelevant. Either they are free to do what they want with the information, or you require restrictive controls over the information you've provided. You can't have it both ways.That's too simplistic. The intention defines what ideally should happen to something.&gt;That's how it always is. Movies are only supposed to be viewed by people who have agreed with the movie producers to see it. The viewer's end required a transfer of money, and the movie maker's end required a transform of the movie. Information for cash.Privacy is not generally for sale. If the intention is to keep something private, you wont be able to buy access to it anywhere.

4362	 thereisnoprivacy	 It doesn't matter what protocol Skype claims to be using. The application is closed-source, and so susceptible to backdooring at the behest of authorities or whomever else.To put things by way of an unambiguous analogy: Microsoft could 'flip the switch' on any user's Skype program and disable the encryption, unbeknownst to the user, if they so choose; and the casual user would never know.This is a transparent attempt by Microsoft to hold on to market share by keeping people using Skype by being able to point and say 'see our stuff is secure and private', while in reality it is anything but.	
4363	 JustaReverseFridge	 screenshot capture algorithm... not sure I'm aware of what you mean, are you talking about security cameras or something... If your talking about screenshotting on a computer, thats impossible what your saying without spyware

4366	 hivecircuit	 i was more talking about with phones or mobile devices. The main things on mobile devices that get targeted are the keyboard via a keylogger, and then the screenshot capture algorithim. In order to log screenshots constantly it would require way more data then logging every keystroke. But i dont know the extent of which the screenshot capture is happening. Id imagine if it is happening its selectively or in intervals of some sort, like every 5 or 10 seconds or something.	
4367	 JustaReverseFridge	 if there was a screeenshot every 5 seconds then you would notice, It would have to send it to whoever is hacking the algorithm and you would see the traffic if you use pihole (imo, everyone should)	
4368	 hivecircuit	 Damn alright, so theres no way it may be hidden within data that would appear normal or something encrypted?	
4369	 JustaReverseFridge	 How would they target YOUR device, if your using copperhead or lineage and you dont use insecure apps such as out of date ones or ones with known security vulnerabilities, replace every single app with an fdroid equivalent if possible and your good 	
4370	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; and the dev is a nice guyIf that's sufficient justification for you to abandon best practice, then that's fine. To each their own. We all deviate from security best practices every now and then.But regardless of your personal trade-offs, the best practice remains to minimize your attack surface. If you're using a third party bit of code (such as an add-on), to do something that can be done locally, without the installation of any third party code, then you are unnecessarily expanding your attack surface. It doesn't matter if the dev is a 'nice guy', or if the code is open; running third party code is still a potential attack vector, one that need not exist because the behavior can be replicated locally, albeit with more effort, yes. That's what privacy is, is effort. 	
4371	 Ichthpo	 There are several raspberry pi security camera projects. I haven't actually tried one so can't vouch for them, but that would seem a good place to start looking.

4373	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; Is there an easy way to have a wireless security camera setup without giving up your privacy?Simply put: no. There are any number of ways to remotely intercept wireless signals. Setting up a wired camera system is a safer alternate which limits attacks to local adversaries who have physical access (or extremely close proximity) to the premises.

4379	 TheBrainSlug	 The fact that anyone can examine the code at any time, and see exactly what it is doing. If you are trying to trick or scam someone you usually don't want give them the means to discover that you are doing so, and how you are doing it.  Of course very often no one really looks at open source code (particularly for small projects). But when someone is very open with you, and actually provides you with the means to check that their software does what they say, the way they say it does, and nothing else, that still inspires a degree of trust.   	
4380	 adolpwned	 That sounds like E-Coin, E-Corp, and USA gov. in Mr. Robot

4382	 AmonVa	 i really love my representative and he's on here what the fuck	
4383	 TheBrainSlug	 I think there is a difference in approach here. Copperhead is *security* focused (not privacy focused). The idea behind it was to fix security problems present in stock Android. As a consequence of this they also make root difficult. For good reason: providing root makes you vulnerable to certain kinds of attack (which rely on exploiting root privileges). Root can, however, be used for purposes which enhance privacy (firewalls, adblockers, etc.). I believe that modifying hosts, for example, requires root. I think your choice should depend on your threat model. E.g. are you worried about malware exploiting root, or are you worried about hostile play-store type software phoning home or contacting associated 3rd parties (reporting on your activity?), contacting ad servers, etc.? Really *neither* of these should be a concern if you only run code that you know you can trust. But sometimes it can be hard to make sure that that is the case. So, given this, sometimes you need to make a bit of a security vs. privacy trade-off.

4388	 thracia	 LG G5 has a button to eject the battery. Then after you insert the battery it asks for disk ~~decription~~ decryption password. So, the fingerprint is kind of disabled. Closest thing that I can do.	
4389	 potatoclip	 If you're enabling port forwarding, you should definitely double check the settings. Maybe consider using custom port number and definitely disable password login and use strong public key authentication. There's no need to enable access from WAN however, you can take the notes locally and sync them to other clients once you get to them in your local network.For the hardening part, I'd say the guide has pretty much everything. Since I don't have to deal with backwards compatibility with my systems, I've forced the server to use, AFAIK, maximum security settings with following `sshd_config` content    # General settings    Protocol 2    Port 22    UsePrivilegeSeparation yes    SyslogFacility AUTH    LogLevel INFO    LoginGraceTime 120    PermitRootLogin no    StrictModes yes    IgnoreRhosts yes    HostbasedAuthentication no    IgnoreUserKnownHosts yes    X11Forwarding no    X11DisplayOffset 10    PrintMotd no    PrintLastLog yes    TCPKeepAlive yes    AcceptEnv LANG LC_*    Subsystem sftp /usr/lib/openssh/sftp-server    UsePAM yes    ChallengeResponseAuthentication no    # Public key authentication    PubkeyAuthentication yes    HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key    # Public key of client goes to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys    # Algorithms    KexAlgorithms curve25519-sha256@libssh.org    Ciphers chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com    MACs hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com    # Passwords    PasswordAuthentication no    ChallengeResponseAuthentication no    PermitEmptyPasswords noMy recommendation is to have both the server's and the client's authentication key pair be either ed25519 or RSA-4096 (or 8192 or even 16384):    ssh-keygen -t ed25519    or     ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096Note that if you choose ed25519 keys and if you're using the `sshd_config` above, the `HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key` needs to be changed to `HostKey /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key`Since you only need to generate the key pairs once, you can select longer keys,  leave it running and watch a movie or whatever. The main attack vector against end-to-end encryption over SSH is MITM attack. Since it's local network the chances are small, but it doesn't hurt to record the server's fingerprint when you first generate the key, and compare it with the fingerprint displayed by SSH client before establishing connection. If you forgot to record the server's public key fingerprint during generation, you can check it with    ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub    or    ssh-keygen -lf /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pubThe client's public key should be moved to server using a USB memory, since that doesn't get delivered during handshake. I found the key placement slightly confusing at first so here's a tl;dr:**Keys generated by client*** Private key must be saved to `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, and it should be protected by a strong passphrase (prompted when generating)* Public key must be saved to `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`, and a copy of this must be on server's `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`**Keys generated by server*** Private key must be saved to `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key` (for RSA keys, ed25519 keys have different name) and it must not be protected by passphrase* Public key must be saved to `/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub`. Client won't get a copy of this, but the fingerprint of this key will be stored on client's `~/.ssh/known_hosts` automatically when fingerprint is accepted.

4393	 PM_ME_LUCID_DREAMS	 &gt; If you can use the same IP for each visit to the site, your chances of running into automated security software goes waaaaay down. Home IP addresses change all the time, unless you use a VPN. I suspect they fingerprint you in other ways too.	
4394	 protiotype	 Having no/few friends is better than having mostly fake friends. How many times have you seen people leave work and having the farewell party echo "don't be a stranger"? No one ever follows through. It's the same on Facebook these days.	
4395	 protiotype	 I don't think having a blank profile is good enough (read the article carefully) because you're still contributing to getting friends and acquaintances hooked on it.	
4396	 CurtainClothes	 I mean yeah, I was mainly joking about the phenomenon, not lamenting it. It's not *bad* to have shallow friendships either, even though close ones are more important. Shallow friendships sort of round out your social life, so without Facebook those ones do take more effort, if you're looking for those. 	
4397	 xfds	 Spotify works well without it.	
4398	 protiotype	 I replied because your comment was easy to scroll into - I treated it seriously because I believe the want for keeping "shallow" friendships (i.e., Facebook friends) is what holds most people back from ditching it or experimenting with deactivating it for a week/month/year.I know the "no friends" quip is a standard joke, but it's often still backed by some form of reality for many people. Why else does Facebook dominate over all the myriad of communication options?

That doesn't means all minorities are dictatorial, but the ones the Democrats agree to run are the ones who have agreed to suck up to them, while being labeled a progressive simply for being a minority. This is why I hope the next Dem nominee is a white male, because that would mean he was nominated because of his polices, not because of his skin colors or his genitals.

Although there is no evidence at this point linking this malware to a specific group, the fact that it’s been seen specifically at biomedical research institutions certainly seems like it could be the result of exactly that kind of espionage.And now that it's been shown to be developed by 'just' an American pervert, and not a case of Chinese or Russian espionage, where's Reed's retraction that his initial analysis was nationalist fear-mongering?

4430	 uoxuho	 In addition to the firmware itself being less vulnerable to hacking compared to a router's standard firmware, it also includes features which you can take advantage of to increase your privacy, or to make your life more convenient without sacrificing security/privacy.DDNS will allow you to connect back home from anywhere on the internet.VLANs will allow you to separate untrusted network traffic (e.g. from visitors using your WiFi) from trusted network traffic.VPN will allow you to tunnel all your traffic back home from anywhere on the internet to prevent the services you use from tracking your location over time.SSH will allow you to remotely configure your router without having to worry that you've inadvertently exposed your entire network to the public internet.These are all things that are easy to set up on DD-WRT, for example, and are very difficult or impossible to find on a router's standard firmware.

I don't know anything about which VPNs would be adequate for skirting the Great Firewall, but I'd be happy to expand on Tor bridges if that's something you might be interested in. Let me know if so.

4464	 unique616	 **Is my 23andMe data likely to be useful to law enforcement or the government?**There are a number of technical and legal reasons that 23andMe data is highly unlikely to be useful to law enforcement, and we’d like to highlight a couple of the most important ones.First, 23andMe’s tests are of little use to law enforcement or government because they cannot technically be matched against the information in CODIS or other governmental databases. 23andMe’s genealogy tests use a genotyping technology that produces markers for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), but  law enforcement use a different kind of DNA test that uses markers known as short tandem repeats. This makes comparing the two very difficult. One way to think about the difference between the tests is that 23andMe’s test focuses on how you are like other people, while forensic tests focus on how you are different from other people.If law enforcement presented a scenario in which SNP information was useful to a case, it’s still unlikely that it would be admitted into any legal proceedings for a number of reasons. One reason is a legal principle known as “chain of custody” which requires that a piece of evidence is what it claims to be, or that evidence collected can be reliably connected to a specific individual in order to use it in court. Genetic data collected by 23andMe fails to meet the chain of custody requirement.Our service is offered online, and as a result, we can’t precisely authenticate an individual’s identity when they use our service. In other words, we don’t have any means to “reliably connect” any particular DNA sample to an individual.We have been successful in communicating these, and other, limitations to law enforcement agents when they contact us.  Once law enforcement officials see both the legal and technical limitations of attempting to use the data, they have backed off of their requests.  As a result 23andMe has not released any data to law enforcement to date. We will continue to vigorously protect the privacy and security of our customers’ data. Those protections for customers remain at the core of what we do.	
4465	 am3on	 Not at all. Think about physical keys &amp; locks. I could describe to you precisely how a pin &amp; tumbler locking mechanism works. A lock has a set of spring-loaded pins, and only the right key can align them properly to unlock the door. Having this knowledge in no way sacrifices the security system of the door, because each lock is unique. Each instance of a lock you encounter has a different set of pins with different spacings. With KeePass, you can view the source code and understand exactly how the system works. But like the door lock example, simply knowing how the system works doesn't help anyone break it. Each KeePass database is encrypted with the user-supplied master password, which is obviously different for each instance of a KeePass database you might find lying around.Like others have mentioned, open-source gives you ***greater*** security because you can look at the system and see its not storing your passwords insecurely, or intentionally sending them somewhere else. EDIT: Also think about this: if your password manager HAD to have its program kept secret in order to be secure, then it can't be very secure at all, can it? If there's some flaw in the code that makes it very weak, then it can and will be eventually found and exploited by someone.

4488	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 &gt; Is my plan of using a brand new tablet on public wifi, then destroying it a good one?Not really. It seems like a waste of money to me. If you don't want anything sensitive in plaintext on the hard-drive, after the fact, then encrypt from the very outset. Use Linux with LUKS (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup) and have a partition where you store your sensitive documents. That way if you leave the PC on a train (powered down) then some random person can't forensically comb over the contents.In terms of public wifi, they are sometimes honeypots for hackers and heavily monitored. Someone could correlate the time you went to the cafe with the time you posted the text, so be careful. Then there's also the issue of public wifi being actively hostile networks, so the usual advice: use Tor, proxies, etc

Would it be stored somewhere in the Google cloud world? I am asking because I have always wondered what happens to all of that data when GT is used.

4501	 thereisnoprivacy	 In abiding by the principles of one-time-use, cash-only, and remote-location, you've covered the big items.The only things are left would depend on the resources of your adversary and a 'death by a thousand cuts' attack against you (meaning that while you've cover the big, singular mistakes, you could make many small mistakes that on their own don't matter but if put together can identify you). For example, assuming that your adversary has the requisite resources to do the following (e.g. is a law enforcement agency), the following thousand-cut attack could be something to consider: 1) The post is traced to having been made from the WiFi of this particular McDonald's.2) The McDonald's WiFi event logs are analyzed to identify the MAC addresses of the devices connected at the time the posting was made.3) Based on the manufacturer identified from the MAC address, combined with any other OS information gleaned when the web posting was made, a set of potential devices that likely made the posting is created.4) With your adversary making the calculation that that poster made efforts to conceal their identity, and thus adhered to the one-time-use principle, sales records of devices matching the list created in 3) are subpoenaed from local retailers.5) CCTV footage is subpoenaed from the retailers which sold the suspect devices. 6) CCTV footage from the retailers is matched against CCTV footage from the venue the posting was made from.7) Facial recognition software is run to identify the suspect.Now, obviously there are a lot of things which would have to 'line up' for this chain of events to unfold; but the key takeaway should be that the opposite is true as well: for this or any other deanonymization chain not to be true, an even greater number of things have to 'line up' for you. In other words: your adversaries only have to be lucky once, you have to be lucky always. Except not so much 'lucky' as having thought of every minute detail.

4504	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 It's probably stored somewhere alright, but if using it anonymously, say, with Tor Browser, then attribution is hard to do. My only concern would be GT needs Javascript turned on in order to function, which opens up some attacks like screen resolution, canvas, etc

4506	 Eidbi	 All above yes, but this&gt; ° Switch to Android where you at least some control over the device. NO, NO AND NO! Android is litterally the single worst piece of tracking, ever created. It can track you in dozens of ways, and you will never ever know it. Android with root and tones of configuring can POSSIBLY be made more private than IOS, but even that is not certain.LineageOS on the other hand is a completely different matter. So buying an Android phone, and installing LineageOS right after doing it is a good idea, yes.	
4507	 sixothree	 Seriously. People seem to enjoy being treated poorly; being taken advantage of. Uber's history is clear and well known. The answer is simple. Uninstall the app. Alternatives exist.	
4508	 Eidbi	 &gt; I'm not sure switching to Android is the best idea. Unless you have a device that is well supported by LineageOS you're just replacing Apple, who kinda cares about privacy, with Google, who couldn't care less. Yes. Even worse, Google posts your activity on your Google Account... I mean what the heck is it this bullshit?&gt;You can make Android more private by using Lineage and no GAPPS/Google services, **but it's a lot more work** and is only really possible on well supported lineage devices. With this one I disagree, depending on your device, it can be done in several minutes. 	
4509	 Eidbi	 This!

4514	 FSCK_OFF	 I actually carried one of these for a year (in Canada), so I feel like my knowledge of these systems is relevant.These boxes are used for the Nielsen's rating system. You know TV shows want to know how many people are watching, as do the advertisers. That's how they gauge success, decide which TV shows stay in production, and figure out how much they can make advertisers pay. Nielsen offers cash, coupons, and a unique opportunity to various households. For me the main draw wasn't the cash, it's honestly pitiful. But being one of a small number of sample families means your opinion on media counts a hell of a lot more than most people. Watching a show regularly while wearing a Nielsen's box has the effect of representing hundreds or even thousands of fans, increasing the likelihood that your favourite TV show stays in production by boosting the measured audience. I watched a lot of Discovery Channel and CBC.In the early days of TV ratings, they would have sample families fill out logbooks to show what TV shows and other media they'd watched. But humans make mistakes and forget stuff. Picking up a subaudible signal with a dedicated device is more effective, and eliminates memory based inaccuracies.I wouldn't participate in the Nielsen's program again, knowing what I do now. I simply don't consume enough traditional media to make it worthwhile. But it's a useful system for estimating viewership of traditional content by taking a small sample of consumers. All the terms are fully laid out for the participants, and they can drop out at any time. It's not really a privacy issue, it's a conscious decision to share one's media consumption habits to give networks a better picture of what people like to watch. 	
4515	 dowodenum	 It's not a privacy issue - if you believe their claims that they only collect subaudible tones. And even then, they only state they don't store it - which means they could just sell it without even storing it.	
4516	 nextlevel8	 **Absolutely incorrect information.*  *I don’t even use uber, but I just installed it to check if you’re right, and no, you’re not right.  The option is there.	
4517	 EklektosShadow	 At that point I feel like using serial numbers on game cartridges might be good. And on a “list” you could write like “reddit = Mario 64DS” and you always can find it. Assuming you don’t lose your copy of the game.  Just a fun thought maybe. 	
4518	 FSCK_OFF	 The main point of the ratings boxes is to act as a willing sample. People are given a choice to sign up for this once they're approached, and if they choose to participate they get to represent many people for the purposes of audience count. If someone has an interest in keeping their favourite shows on the air, these boxes can be worth the minor intrusion. It's not like they're sneaking the boxes into people's pockets. The participants are fully aware of the purpose and ability of the devices, and can drop out of the program at any time. I enjoyed being part of the program because I was effectively given multiple votes to help keep the TV shows I liked in production. The cash and coupons were just a bonus, not the main compensation.

4523	 MC_Cuff_Lnx	 He's that sort of person who isn't informed on an issue but will wield it as a club anyway.For instance, he was visibly upset about the OPM hack and he was beating up on the chief on that agency, and angrily asking "WHY WEREN'T THE DATABASES ENCRYPTED?!"It's a live database. You can encrypt the file, but that doesn't prevent access with stolen credentials. Doesn't stop him from flinging shit. Eventually someone on the panel told him that it wouldn't have mattered; he shut up about encryption and moved on to something that mattered.	
4524	 FSCK_OFF	 The purpose of the program is to collect vague statistics, not detailed information about one person. The contracts involved are very clear about not selling individual information, just the overall anonymized statistics.So I honestly believe that they wouldn't need to sell information about the specifics. They're in the business of market statistics, not individual advertisement the way Google and other online advertisers do. Keep in mind that they've been around for decades, and TV doesn't let you restrict your advertisements to a particular demo. They want to know what kind of people and how many of them watch each TV show and movie.I represented a white Canadian male, aged 15-18 (at the time) who enjoyed sci-fi, news, and comedy. My viewing statistics would be grouped in with those from other Nielsen's families and aggregated to put together nationwide viewing stats. I was happy to represent my demographic.Also, you can't sell something without storing it, that's nonsensical. They take the information about viewership, toss it into their formulas, and sell the numbers that come out the other side. Everyone involved in the program knows this and consents to it.

If you're interested, DM me.	
4536	 FSCK_OFF	 The main thing with Copperhead is that it doesn't come with google play services installed. You can get many of the same privacy effects by installing any ROM without play services, and using apps from the F-Droid store instead. The biggest COS tweaks are things like kernel level memory hardening, which doesn't affect the average user. Because they're very low level modifications they have to restrict the work to a few models for compatibility reasons. LineageOS will work just as well for most people.	
4537	 syboxez	 Security through obscurity (what you're describing here) is a false form of security.For example, think of the security of game consoles. These consoles are completepy proprietary and they are designed to be platforms for DRM. These consoles get hacked to play pirated games, regardless of the fact that they are proprietary systems. Many times, these exploits are things that are hard to believe got through bug testing, such as Sony using the same random number for their keys for the PS3, or the PS2's KELF loading alternate OSs from memory cards or hard drives, which was cracked and FreeMCBoot came from that.Another major reason to avoid proprietary software, especially for security, is the fact that some software may have backdoors hidden inside of them, and many times that backdoor comes in the form of a bug that was left purposefully unpatched.The more eyes that can verify the security of software (and hardware), the better.

4557	 claytonkb	 Good answers already. Another frequently overlooked point is that encryption is not synonymous with security. You can have the best encryption in the world but if your endpoint (personal computer, mobile device) is compromised, it makes no difference. For example, if there is a keylogger installed by malware on your system, and this malware also siphons common locations of password manager files out to a server controlled by the malware writer, your information can be compromised. So, security is a holistic problem, not just a question of having one piece of secure software installed on your system.

4562	 _-IDontReddit-_	 No. Symmetric algorithms are quantum resistant. The most you can do with a quantum computer is half the effective keyspace through Grover's algorithm. So 256-bit ciphers are effective 128-bit which is still unbreakable (AES256, ChaCha20). 192-bit ciphers are marginal (96-bit is close to the margin today, but as far as we know no one has broken this strength get). 128-bit ciphers are broken.The only things completely broken are public key algorithms like RSA or elliptic curves.

4591	 Abalamahalamatandra	 Firstly and formost, the SHA256 algorithm is a **hashing** algorithm, not an encryption algorithm.  Hashes are used to generate a unique value computed from a given sequence of bits, and to verify that sequence of bits have not been altered.Encryption algorithms are used to obscure the meaning of a given sequence of bits by scrambling them in a reversible way using a key.Now, secondly, I am not aware that either the SHA256 hashing algorithm, nor the AES encryption algorithm with an appropriate key size (likely 256 bits) have been compromised.  If that were known to be the case, you can bet a whole lot of people would be scrambling right now.edit: word	
4592	 FSCK_OFF	 &gt;they are screwing actual market researchers who work for a living out of a livelihood.Could you explain what you mean by that? Nielsen has been doing radio and TV ratings since the 1940s, and this is just the way they do it today. It's more accurate and far more convenient to pick up subaudible tones than to try and remember to log your viewing and listening habits in a book. It also doesn't replace market research, nor is it meant to. Nielsen ratings are meant to be a representation of who and how many people *actually watch* shows and listen to radio stations, not just sitting people down and asking them what they think of an episode. Neither one gets the full picture, so networks use a combination of both.Market research happens first, Nielsen ratings come out *after* a show airs.&gt;This information is worth at least $2,000 a yearAs I explained above, it's not a one way street. Yes, participants are allowing Nielsen to mine the shit out of the data they collect, but they also get to influence ratings in a direct way, having their media preferences extrapolated to represent hundreds or thousands of people.Unless you take a Stallman-esque approach to the internet, advertising companies get far more information out of you than Nielsen ever got from my little black box.

4601	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 The problem is that many local ISPs are decidedly worse than the big players in terms of service and price. For example, my city's municipal fiber is run by a private company with the following rates:* $40 for 15/10 down/up* $70 for 30/10 down up* no contacti can get Comcast 60/50 for $30 with a 1 year contract. That's a pretty stupid premium for a service that still goes out every month or so for a couple hours at a time.I really want to avoid Comcast, but in my area it's strictly better than the alternative. I think my ISP made the mistake of running Cat 5e the last mile, hence why they cannot offer competitive speeds despite having fiber throughout the city...Edit: it might be 60/10, I don't know. I have my municipal service because screw Comcast, but they're able to offer a better product at a better price even though the entire city has "fiber" available. I'm considering switching to Comcast for a year just to punish my local ISP for being so lame, though I'll make sure to call them first to explain the situation.

4606	 DemeGeek	 I question your use of "many", do you have evidence that local ISPs other than yours also have this issue?	
4607	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 Maybe it's 60/10, idk. I just know it's as good or better than our municipal internet (which I currently use, I'm on the 15/10 plan because I hate Comcast).I really don't understand why our municipal fiber network can't compete. They have the infrastructure, they should be able to offer a super high tier (1 gbps) for a competitive price ($60-70/month), but they don't.	
4608	 BurningToAshes	 are you proposing the NSA doesnt spy on US citizens?I must be missing something. 	
4609	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 I can cite a few others in my area (all independent), but I don't have statistics for anything more broad than that. We also have a fiber service here (in select parts of select cities) that's really good on price ($30 for 50/50 or so, apparently 10 GBe is available to residential customers now) but really bad on availability, and the availability problem is because of mismanagement (they're really far in debt).And that's my beef with municipal broadband. Since they're tax funded instead of privately funded, they don't have to turn a profit and thus aren't motivated to expand service at a rate that a private company would or as cheaply. This is a problem that cities need to solve, yet so few cities work together to do so, and as a result tend to repeat the same failures over and over. At least that's been my experience with the places I've lived.There are definitely success stories, but there are lots of failures as well. My city is still paying for its foray into fiber (they sold rights to run the network years ago to a private firm, but still needs to pay down the installation cost) years after putting it in, and it's still a subpar service.My current service is way better than the other two cities I lived in. The first had their own fiber network, which was sold at a huge loss to a big fiber company, who rescued the network and expanded it. The second was millions in debt and the majority of the city didn't have access to it years after starting the program. My current one is at least ubiquitous and reasonably priced, but they cannot compete on bandwidth.In fact, the most successful municipal ISPs in my area have been fixed wireless (each neighborhood has an antenna, with Cat 5 running to each house). They're cheap to install, easy to service, and reasonably good (though they don't scale well since they're bandwidth limited).	
4610	 Thecklos	 If you didn't have local your cable provider would probably have much higher rates, or slower service.

4613	 [deleted]	 MEGA comes to mind, with client-side encryption and a promise that they cannot decrypt your files. Of course, these are just promises but they're coming from Dotcom, a well-known privacy advocate.Otherwise Nextcloud is probably your best bet, if you can afford a $5/month VM for hosting it. Takes less than an hour to set up and offers you the ability to do as you will with your own storage.	
4614	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I 100% agree that open-source- and especially free and open-source- software will be more important than ever if we are to retain our rights and our control over our own future.I think though it should be obvious that corporate entities will do *everything* in their power to take away those rights and that control- them having control allows them to make more profits. They will jam closed source proprietary crap down our throats incessantly. If we let them, they will have signed bootloaders and more to *ensure* that FOSS can't be used instead.This is similar to the US smartphones offered at various carriers.

4617	 noUsernameIsUnique	 Hmm. Sounds like competition has driven their prices down and increased their down/up speeds; so you’re a beneficiary of capitalism’s invisible hand. But you’re unique in many respects. I’ve lived in several US major cities where local providers were not an option, we pay monthly double what you pay major-telco for half your claimed speeds. It’s competition that determines prices friend, and they’re leveraging their economies of scale to compete for your dollars rather than losing you to municipal ISP. So if anything, as a consumer, be grateful for your local market’s capitalistic competition.

4624	 stonecats	  honestly, i don't get why more people (over 30mil usa households have 2 broadband isps) don't simply share their broadband with a neighbor or two, using a wire thru a common wall or a wireless bridge.  you can even set this up so each neighbor has his own wifi ssid using guest networks in the same local dhcp/nat router.  you can frustrate your isp's ability to detect you sharing by avoiding that isps dns servers, or better yet using encrypted dns, even better a router based vpn.  once my last mile got both a cable and fiber isp (so if one banned me for sharing i could get service from the other) i setup a wireless bridge to a neighbor, and we've been happily sharing the same isp ever since without a single issue from the neighbor or isp.  (also if your last mile has 2 isp's, one won't wonder why you don't have service, they'll simply assume you are signed up with the other).  i do use encrypted dns but i have not bothered with a vpn because nobody p2p's here, we only use pirate video streams - which is not illegal for the viewer because we can't retain a copy of the video.one last concern about sharing - don't if your wired isp tb/mo caps you.  my neighbor falls asleep to the stream as i often notice them still using bandwidth at 3am when i get up to pee - LOL.  if you still want to share on a tb/mo capped isp, what i did was invest the savings (from sharing an isp) into a hdhomerun+nas so we can share ota+dvr which works like a charm even wireless on the same lan segment, thus saves on the need to stream thru your isp.  since doing this my avg monthly bandwidth consumption has decreased by a third even with 4 adults on the same isp.  my extra equipment investment paid for itself in under a year from the savings of not getting 2 isp services between us.if you want to share with a neighbor but want more privacy from that neighbor, you can still share and set up each one of you on their own lan segment, BUT then you can't do cool things like share a ota lan tuner, nas dvr and any other intentionally network published devices - like we do.  once i demonstrated to my neighbor that it was not possible for me to see anything inside a password protected device beyond it's total bandwidth consumption, then they felt more comfortable being on the same lan segment together.*it's just a shame we can't safely do this for the natural gas to our ovens - if you look at your gas bill, 95% of it is tax and overhead while only 5% is the gas you actually consume.*	
4625	 deliciouswaffles99	 So to clarify, there is a distinction between first-party and third-party cookies? I was confused as I read an article that countered against the idea that there was a difference as first-party cookies become third-party cookies when visiting another website.The way I initially understood it was that company A's first-party cookies are used to advertise products on company B's website. However, if I am understanding you correctly, company T (the advertising company) uses information on your browsing habits to show you relevant ads, but in no way does company T have access to the cookie stored by company A (which includes your login credentials &amp; personally identifiable information), unless website A leaks the information to T. Furthermore, in the case where A leaks information to T, does T identify that link between the browsing habits collected and the personally identifiable information to company A and in-turn the host? Or does T just provide anonymous data?

4665	 cBvOh76Zo2i9	 Elementary OS, a beginner-focused distro, implements the Parthenon DE, which is an almost exact rip-off of MacOS’ design language... it’s beautiful, but as a former MacOS user, it is a bit ‘uncanny valley’ for me.	
4666	 cBvOh76Zo2i9	 I don’t believe that MacOS is even still UNIX-certified; in fairness, neither is Linux, so that’s alright... MacOS and Linux share several similarities, and the XNU/Darwin kernel is based off of the NetBSD kernel. The basic paradigms are similar as is the philosophy.	
4667	 cBvOh76Zo2i9	 It offers advantages that are outweighed by the performance and practicality costs... all the benefits can be replicated by configuring Firefox properly.	
4668	 cBvOh76Zo2i9	 The golden duo would be fingerprint plus password, but for some reason, no OS has implemented that as of yet... it would be something you have plus something you know. It gives you the legal benefits of a password and the security benefits of a biometric login.	
4669	 cBvOh76Zo2i9	 I would predict that Reddit keeps a back catalogue of all posts, even deleted—in fact, this has been all but confirmed. To delete all posts without switching accounts offers no meaningful privacy benefits aside from a small layer of protection against potential doxxers. I believe that there is an online host of Shreddit from the developer, but you have to trust that he won’t collect data.I always use Shreddit plus a new account on a semi-random basis, and I transfer across my subscriptions manually.

To determine what is fishy you can often use google. A closed port is not "very cool", it's just the default.Pessimist answer: With such a poor understanding of IT-security you are likely to be exploited sooner or later, and using your webcam has nothing to do with it. 	
4705	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 Sort of. I think it's also competition from fixed wireless providers (I can get 100 mbit down for $60) and DSL (12 or 40 mbit depending on area for $30-40). The municipal fiber *should* be the option with the fastest speeds, and neighboring fiber options have gigabit and one has 10 gbit for residential customers.I *am* grateful that we have good competition, but I'm annoyed that our fiber offering is so uncompetitive with speed.	
4706	 Raeene	 Considering there is no open source printer firmware, and they've been around for 30 years — I'm not so confident...	
4707	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; Could you explain what you meant by that including what is U2F, VC, Nitrokey?There's an abundance of websites with much more elaborate explanations of what all these things are than I could provide here. Type them into a search engine.In short: it's an extra security measure where instead of just typing your password you're also required to insert a physical dongle into your computer when signing-in to certain websites that support this measure (or unlocking your encrypted data, as is the case here). So you would get a U2F dongle, such as NitroKey, and when you wanted to decrypt your VeraCrypt drive you would both need to input your password and insert the dongle into your computer. 	
4708	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 I know, right? That's why I'm so annoyed about my service. I can get 4x the speed for the same price I'm paying now. My main concern now is whether it's worth giving money to Comcast.I'm definitely not going to pay $70 for 30mbit because of the other options I have, and I honestly don't understand why they charge so much for it *and* cap at 30 mbit. Even if they're ruining Ethernet on the last mile, they could upgrade the Ethernet to Cat 6 and get gigabit speeds for select customers without doing *anything* further with fiber (if they did conduit, this would be a 1hr job for one person per house)... It's just so stupid.

4710	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 I live in Utah County, which is the county south of SLC. SLC has Utopia, which is a fiber co-op between several cities that includes a city I used to live in (but neither I nor anyone I know in that city has Utopia service). We also have Provo as a Google fiber city, and I lived there before Google fiber came in and the fiber offering was similarly only available to part of the city and was overpriced.So, I've lived in three cities in the same county, all with a fiber offering with different results. I also have coworkers who live in other cities with municipal internet with mixed results.I think my area is a pretty good representation of what to expect for areas that have municipal fiber offerings since we have lots of tech companies (and thus reason to expand service) and a lot of families (meaning lots of teenage gamers and family movie nights, both of which require reasonably good bandwidth).Edit: Also, are you surprised that I go out of my way to not say where I live on a privacy sub?

4712	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 I think they're mad that I have better internet options than them and am complaining. That's true to an extent, though I'm merely trying to say that municipal fiber in and of itself isn't a panacea.Fiber can still be incompetent and overpriced for the local market, and that's my relevant experience and apparently Reddit doesn't like my experience.	
4713	 Formaggio_svizzero	 Liking money doesn't necessarely have to be connected to unethical business tactics..	
4714	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 I have two or three other options. I can get fixed wireless 60mbit for $60 and in many areas I can get DSL 40mbit for $40. So yeah, I think Comcast would be similarly priced if there wasn't a municipal fiber option, and I've been in areas where I chose that DSL over a less expensive Comcast option because I hate Comcast.

4733	 uoxuho	 You should start using a password manager. A password manager is a program which allows you to save all of your different passwords in a central location. This means that you don't have to remember all of your different passwords, so you can use long and secure passwords on all of your different accounts (using a different password on each account).You save all of your passwords in a single password database, which is then encrypted with the "master" password. You only need to remember this one password in order to access all of your other passwords. For your "master" password, you should check out [Diceware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diceware), which allows you to create a password that's long and very difficult for someone to guess, but will be reasonable for you to remember and type. It uses words instead of random characters, so instead of a password that looks like this:`}v@?A&lt;j9\5CKVGhz`...You use a password that looks like this:`excursion savor slander rinsing bonnet plank kilogram daily`If English is not your first language, there are other wordlists in other languages that you might want to check out, so that your passphrase is in your native language and is hopefully easier to memorize.That should be a significant improvement to your current situation. Get started now and you can have all of your passwords changed and saved in your password manager in about an hour. After that, use Veracrypt to implement full-disk encryption on your computer.&gt; Is Veracrypt the only such software on Windows? Can you confirm? It's not the only one. Bitlocker is Microsoft's encryption software built into Windows, but is not preferable because it is not open source. There are others, I'm sure, but I'm not up-to-date on what is available.&gt; Which software does Tails OS for this purpose? Tails OS comes with multiple encryption programs pre-installed. It has dm-crypt available to create encrypted USB disks, it has GPG available to send and receive PGP-encrypted emails, and it has Pidgin with OTR available for end-to-end encrypted messaging.&gt; What happened to TrueCrypt?Development was discontinued in 2014. VeraCrypt is a fork of TrueCrypt.

4736	 uoxuho	 First, allow me to assume that you're able to keep your computer secure from your housemates. If a housemate can simply use your computer whenever they want, then you are at much greater risk of them being able to see your posts/messages/username, because they can try to access your browser history or maybe even install a keylogger on your computer.So assuming your computer itself is secure, then there are a couple things you should know. When you first connect to a website, your computer makes a DNS request, where it tries to determine the IP address associated with a website's name. This usually happens in plaintext (out in the open, without encryption). This means that under most circumstances, someone watching your network can see that you intend to access a particular website, like `www.reddit.com` or `www.youtube.com` or `www.porhub.com`.Once your computer knows the IP address that it needs to connect to, and it begins to create a secure HTTPS connection, then it usually sends the hostname in plaintext again (out in the open, without encryption). This is because of something called [Server Name Indication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication). This means that under most circumstances, someone watching your network can see that you are beginning your connection to a particular website, like `www.reddit.com` or whatever else.Now for the good news. Once the HTTPS connection happens, all of the *content*, including the names of the pages you visit, is encrypted. This means that someone watching your network might know you are connected to `www.reddit.com`, but they won't know that you're at `www.reddit.com/r/privacy`, or what your username is, or what your messages are.So there were three separate things I mentioned:1. DNS requests might allow someone to find out what website you're visiting.2. SNI might allow someone to find out what website you're visiting.3. HTTPS will prevent anyone from finding out what you're actually doing on that website.So if you want to keep even the website you're visiting from anyone on your network, you'll need to address both points 1 and 2. You can address the DNS issue by using DNSCrypt, but you usually can't address the SNI issue since most websites make it mandatory.A way to work around both of these issues at the same time is to use an encrypted proxy such as Tor or VPN software. **So my tl;dr for you** is that you should setup an OpenVPN server at your parents' house to "move" the vulnerable parts of your internet connection from your frat house to your parents' house, or you should subscribe to a cheap VPN provider to "move" the vulnerable parts of your internet connection from your frat house to your VPN provider.In general, remember that *someone* can always see what website you're connecting to.I hope that all made sense; let me know if you need more information on anything.	
4737	 gratua	 I'm starting to go off topic a bit here, or I'm just revealing how little I know of the tech...I think it'd be great to see these municipalities storing some data. Not personally identifiable, duh. I'm thinking like, most common data requests. Obviously, the internet is enormous and user requests are endless. I'm just wondering how much of it is unnecessarily repeated. Keep a cache of major websites locally.

4743	 Remi1115	 Interesting read, thanks for sharing.Have you got guides with requirements for setting this up?Like; you'll want to indeed have separate (V)LAN's for the homes. I guess if your main router runs OpenWRT or something similar this would be easy to setup. And, if you are the connections registrant, it's nice to route every other home's traffic through a VPN service (maybe give every home their own VPN subscription, though that will make it less scalable financially), but that limits their internet in some way (higher latency, can't expose services to the internet (maybe their child wants to host a game server for a evening to play with friends)).Edit:Now that I think of you, theoretically you could go for just a simple switch as the main connection point, and telling the users to install their own router, with a VPN if they'd like. This would mean the users don't have to trust the person sysadmining not looking through their requests, but it would mean the sysadmin can't be sure all traffic goes through a VPN.

4745	 CryptoxGEEK	 On the community Internet idea, so how could you even possibly start? The reason I ask is at some point a want to establish an artist's community on land, possibly as a tourist point of interest. A shared crafts store and other resources for large items, a amphitheatre for talks and demos and of course Internet for the group. A series of workshop/apartments for artists to stay year round or seasonally for those that travel the craft shows. Where are you going to get your interconnect point the the NET? Not at a conventional ISP source as all clearly have no redisribute/resale clauses. Is there an option that I'm overlooking? Can someone explain in a block flowchart for a community based ISP and how it can be built, participate and overcome neutrality isuues and blocking upstream. On the N'gas issue, I'll confirm that but closer to 12% here. On $12.70 for amount gas usage there is cust chg $19.28, WNA rider? $1.35, GCR rider? 60.21, FF rider $5.20, Tax rider $2.10, Tax city $1.05 so in all there is a total of $89.11 tacked on to the gas actually used... sheez! (Always heard propane in a rural setting is more expensive, but looking at 88% add-on to actual usage, even 2x-3x it would average out cheaper in time on your own supply?).	
4746	 CriticalException	 For this reason I went over to Linux a year ago. I didn't missed Windows for a second since then.    	
4747	 Idas_Hund	 With the risk of being heavily downvoted; installing a free and open source operating system is the only real solution to your issue. The tools that helps with these kinds of issues is only temporary workarounds at best. You can put makeup on a pig, but it will still be a pig.But I do understand that some are unfortunately more or less forced to use Windows due to their work or maybe gaming. My recommendation there is to only do what's absolutely necessary in Windows, preferable in a virtual machine if possible and then use Linux (or whatever floats your boat) for everything else.

4751	 jeremiahs_bullfrog	 Big ISPs do just that, which they've titled "fast lanes". For example, websites like Netflix will collocate a server at the ISP so your movie doesn't have to stream all the way from Netflix's servers but instead comes from the ISP's data center. The most popular shows are stored at the ISP to reduce bandwidth across "the internet".Here's how it works ([crappy image for reference](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.tvXkpHoDHCCHTRPLTgWIXgHaEr&amp;pid=15.1&amp;f=1)):* your request goes to the ISP (e.g. you're on the right, and your ISP is the NSP you're connected to)* ISP finds a path to the service provider (e.g. Netflix) though other network service providers* Netflix streams the response back over that path to the ISP* ISP hands the data stream to youIf it's encrypted (e.g. https), the ISP *cannot* cache that data, which is a good thing because then they cannot see what data you're requesting. If they were able to, then connections are subject to replay attacks (e.g. an attacker could impersonate you and login to your bank account without your password by just relaying data that they've captured). Before encryption, your ISP could maintain caches to make things faster (that's how AOL worked back in the day).So, to reduce total bandwidth usage, instead of the ISP breaking encryption, they instead bring the server within their internet. Large data users (Netflix, YouTube, etc) would maintain servers inside the ISPs (the NSP your LAN is connected to) so it doesn't take up bandwidth on the general internet (the connections between ISPs). The ISP pays for time on "the internet" (e.g. they pay some amount to other ISPs to route their data), so they want to minimize data sent. Colocation is also a cost savings to the content provider (Netflix needs to pay its own internet bill), so the ISP wants to charge for that service.Then Net Neutrality comes in to force ISPs to not take this extra profit (charge for colocation). Whether this is good or bad depends on your ISP. Some ISPs can manage "fast lanes" fairly, though ISPs with a monopoly can recognize that some services are more valuable them others and essentially extort money from them (e.g. more people watching Netflix than Disney streaming could encourage the ISP to charge Netflix more per GB transferred).Many people think Net Neutrality means more than it does. All Net Neutrality means is that ISPs can't charge a company more because they stream more and it regulates how much ISPs can charge for colocation. Netflix doesn't care that their quantity of streaming is costing ISPs money, so ISPs want a way to recoup costs.Hopefully that was helpful. Feel free to ask if your have questions.	
4752	 berryer	 Depends - at scale, a government monopoly can be just as bad as ISPs' current infrastructural monopoly. Small (town/city-based) systems are much easier to keep honest, though, just like small businesses.E.g. this is among reasons why road maintenance should be handled at the city/county level, not the federal level.

4758	 the0riginal28	 I wouldn't focus on individual cases...ESPECIALLY someone getting caught doing something they shouldn't (your priest example).

4759	 _kusochi	 Ah I do like the "by default, block" mentality and that's why I have used uMatrix. But it blocks all of the 3rd party domains as it doesn't know which 3rd party domains contain the 1st party analytics. This works if the website has the analytics in the same domain though.

Ever since Windows 7 Ultimate it's been a downhill run in klunkyness, patching and spying by MS.Considering another pass at the Virtual PC sessions route if I can still run the programs I need professionally. Otherwise the open office suites meet most other needs along with the addition of a good database.	
4776	 fonikz	 My city refuses to do anything right on the grounds of preserving historical value. The school system is getting worse and worse despite pouring money into modern facilities. The private schools are much, MUCH better, as private schools tend to be. City utilities have constant issues, and they buy their power from the other local energy co-ops and corporations. The trash pickup is privatized for $20 a month and I have no complaints at all.Here's what people (seem to) fail to understand. Things aren't free, nothing is. Your tax dollars are paying money for them, you just don't get a voice in the quality of what you're paying for. It goes out to the lowest bidder in a lot of cases, which is often the lowest quality as well. If it's not the lowest bidder then it's somebody's buddy. I don't live in the worst city but if I had options, if I had competitors to choose from, I absolutely would pick the best one within my budget. Which is not what my local government can provide.

4783	 stonecats	 everyone's isp share has different priorities, so it's hard to guild you on what is best in your case.  i can only speak for my own priorities and experience.  over the years i have built good trust with this neighbor, so the priority was - don't use wire between apts, keep our share undetectable to our neighbors and the isp(s), keep uptime latency and speed as full and dependable as possible.to accomplish this i use a robust main  dual channel wifi router running dd-wrt, and use cheap dumb dual channel wifi routers as wifi bridges and end points using their built in firmware.  in my apt most devices are 1gig wired, leaving the majority of my wifi bandwidth dedicated to the bridge to my neighbor (same floor 30' away thru 3" of plaster walls).  i use qos to control latency and bufferbloat between me and the isp, and i also qos within my lan so no single connection can use over 80% of available bandwidth - this helps maintain the illusion of constant uptime since any one person during a long hard download can't hog the bandwidth from others.while i did experiment for a while vpn'ing everything, i later settled on a dnscrypt type solution in the main router itself.  it's 100% uptime reliable and dsnleaktest shows it works perfectly.i should point out that wifi is an inexact science which requires trail and error positioning the main and bridge routers and their sticks so they talk to each other as well as possible.  in addition i defined 2.4 and 5.0 wifi as two separate ssid named set of bridge connections so if one gets congested from a neighbor's traffic, the bridge falls over to depending more on the other.after 2 years my neighbor and i (we both own our coops) have agreed to pursue a cat6 data wire between apts (i came up with a clever way to disguise it even if either of us later sell our apt), which means i will later convert the wifi bridge to a wired endpoint - the main benefit being slightly lower latency and less concern about neighbor wifi interference.

4785	 stonecats	 since you will get a business class isp service, sharing won't be a problem (i'm paying for a cheaper residential service which my tos says i can't share).  the bigger issue is how to get the last mile broadband connection near your campus, set up cyber cafe style wifi access account management (for staff vendors visitors which you can meter and even bill them), and then line of sight wifi bridging dish between each electrified building so everyone can enjoy your wifi. while near each of your buildings.  depending on distances and layout you can also consider micro trenching fiber or underground jacketed copper pairs between buildings or piggy backing however buildings are being electrified.  none of this is hard of very expensive, it just takes a realistic budget and someone on your staff handy and network savvy enough to document and see it thru.  if broadband is critical, you must make it's confirmed availability part of your land lease decision.  do NOT take any area's real estate agent or even the ISP's word for you, get boots on the ground to visit neighbors to the land you are considering and confirm THEY have broadband already and what limits there are on their service.  if the building you lease on this land is not already connected to the area last mile, you may have to pay tens of thousands of dollars to the ISP to bring their service to your campus main building.  if the land you consider has poor cellular service (which you may have little control or influence over) having campus broadband becomes a lot more critical to the modern attraction of your accommodations.

4798	 Nefandi	 The difference between the Democrats and the Republicans is that the Democrats are just more polite and less extreme about their capitalist ambitions.  Both parties readily accept donations from the big money interests.  It's a rare politician who does not and so far refusing donations from big money interests is not a part of the platform for the Democratic party.  Think carefully about what this means.So long as the Democratic party is not opposed to accepting donations from big money interests, whom do you think they will really want to represent?The Democrats could in principle be taken over by the politicians who are aligned with the 99%, and that's what a group like the "[Justice Democrats](https://www.justicedemocrats.com/)" is about.  But until that happens, one should not assume the Democrats are on the side of the people.  The Dems are very much a top-down management party that represents the super-rich, but they're just less insane than the Republicans.  So there are differences between the two parties, but these differences do not amount to much for those who truly want big progressive changes in society.Neither party wants to introduce deep structural reforms that are necessary and sufficient to cure the wealth inequality dynamics which result in our crazy and still rising level of the wealth inequality.Banana republic wealth inequality.  Banana republic politics.  It shouldn't be surprising.If we want a change in the status quo, the Democrats in their present shape are not our friend.  If the Justice Democrats succeed in their ambition, maybe the Democrats can once again reasonably represent the common person.  Otherwise we might need to move to a third party of some sort, if we still want *real* representation.

4821	 fonikz	 Voting doesn't necessarily always work out. You're counting on the rest of your community/city/state/country to make an educated decision with you, instead of making decisions that will directly benefit you.By your logic, you support the current Presidential administration and the Net Neutrality rulings and all other forms of government, just because it was voted for.

4829	 BananaDonkChevy	 Voting always works out.  If the majority of people in your city want city-provided internet, you get it.  That's literally the definition of functional voting.  If you are against ALL government regulation because you occasionally disagree with your fellow citizens, you're gonna be in for a rough time.Once again, you're mixing federal and local government into the same argument.  It doesn't work like that.  You don't go down to city hall to rile your neighbors up into pulling our soldiers out of Libya... but let me know how that privatized fire department and library work out for you.  Sounds dandy.   I hope re-paving the road leading to your grocery store doesn't bankrupt you.  If it does, see if your neighbors will pitch in to help foot the bill.

4832	 userkp5743608	 First, you need to understand what you're actually asking. Are you really trying to be anonymous, or do you just want privacy? They are not the same thing.Do you need anonymity, or as close as is practically achievable? Before you answer yes, then ask yourself if you're a dissident, activist, journalist, criminal, etc. If your answer remains yes, then you have a steep learning curve ahead of you and you need to be prepared to make some serious sacrifices in terms of convenience in order to achieve even a limited degree of comfort that you're accessing the internet anonymously. This means (but is by no means limited to), changing the type of computer you use, the operating system installed on it, what physical locations you use to access the internet (not your home), the means by which you connect (Tor exclusively which means sacrificing all high-speed capability), limiting the types of services you use (many block Tor or break when accessing with Tor - I haven't been able to figure out how to setup a Twitter account), never doing anything online under your real identity (shopping, etc), rooting your smartphone and installing a different OS (or ditching the smartphone entirely), carrying your phone in a Faraday bag, and powering it on only when you need to do something very specific before powering it off and putting it back in the Faraday bag. And that's just the starting basics. True anonymity is extraordinarily difficult to achieve and never guaranteed. Your technical setup as well as your procedural habits must be flawless, all the time, every time with no exceptions. It's an incredibly high bar.If you're just looking for increased privacy, then the threshold is much lower and more manageable. Get off Google, Facebook, etc. Get a VPN. Setup Firefox properly. Get a private email service. And be prepared to pay for it all. There is no such thing as free on the internet. Period. Google and Facebook are **not** free. They are selling your identity as the product. That's the price of "free" Gmail.Edit: www.privacytools.io is a solid place to start.

4851	 H7LzhZxV5fvJaAjjeiew	 &gt; Is there a difference with respect to privacy? Is one more secure than another?No.Registering your home number on Signal seems like an option. Then setting a voicemail explaining that you are not using the phone network.	
4852	 H7LzhZxV5fvJaAjjeiew	 Good stuff.	
4853	 Facelessnotnameless	 Applocks aren't very good for protecting content if at all. They are less than useless to someone who knows what they're doing.That being said if you really care about hiding content on your phone I would suggest having your phone encrypted and having a good lockscreen password and not rely on an applock as it can be very easily defeated.I don't know what you say on Kik that leads you to having an app lock but assume that someone at some point may be able to read the messages.If you really care about someone being able to read your messages use an encrypted alternative such as Signal.Also if your worried about someone hacking your phone, again, assume it has already been hacked (within reason) make sure to keep any data off it you don't want falling in the wrong hands	
4854	 Qwbc	 Ads would take the main point away from Tor. Tor was designed to secure anonymity. While millions of users on the Tor nodes would certainly confuse advertisers, it could just as easily be used to track people throughout their usage of the service.

I suspect "digital voice" from your cable provider is equally competent, and it has the advantage of a completely segregated voice path. If possible, try to find a supplier using webrtc. That guarantees you the Opus codec.All companies switching through the public switched telephone network must provide wiretap access via CALEA laws. Even so, some companies actually claim to still demand a warrant before providing such access. Just understand it's a certain bet that no telephone company will ever go to jail for you - despite what our Constitution says.With Signal - you aren't required to trust anyone. And it actually provides a decent sounding call. Approaching from a sound quality standpoint is the best way to get family members to switch over to Signal.Many use both methods. Telephone for transactions with outsiders, Signal for family.

4860	 vivekkhera	 The signal protocol used by both of these apps has repudiation built in of the form that either party can create the message in a two party chat. So then it comes down to your word against the other in the two party chat as to who actually said what. I don’t know what else you mean by anonymous.

4869	 EccentricCentric	 &gt;So long as the Democratic party is not opposed to accepting donations from big money interests, whom do you think they will really want to represent?... But until that happens, one should not assume the Democrats are on the side of the people. [Russ Feingold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_election_in_Wisconsin,_2010) tried that in 2010 and lost. He stood on principle, refused corporate donations, and got heavily outspent by his opponent. When he ran for his old seat in 2016, he tried to get his opponent to [agree to limit superPAC spending](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/12/russ-feingold-super-pac_n_7573360.html); that didn't work, either.No, not all Democrats are as principled. But to expect them to shoot themselves in the foot on principle is setting yourself up for disappointment, one way or another.This is the same Feingold who was the only Senator to [vote againt the PATRIOT Act](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/23/how-far-russ-feingold-campaign-finance-reform).

4871	 tman37	 So refute it's arguments. 55 Major league Democrats voted to give Trump and the executive branch the right to spy on Americans. Why do they consistently vote to increase the power of the executive if the person in power is as evil as they say?This isn't just a Democrat issue. Obama governed by executive order more than any other president in history and the republican consistently voted for more executive powers as did the Dems under Bush.For some time now, politics has been about what did I say not what did I do. In an age where we have instant access to information and can find out who voted for what almost in real time, we still choose words over actions. We care more about virtue signalling than actions that would actually support those supposed virtues. Conversely, we care more about whether or not Trump called some countries shit holes in a closed door meeting (like he was the first one ever to say something like that) than we do about his actual policies.Stop listening to politicians, on both sides, and focus on what they actually do. 	
4872	 JustaReverseFridge	 first of all, tweaking settings doesnt mean shit, facebook,google,apple,microsoft etc have proven that they don't give a flying fuck about your settings and that they will collect whatever info they please, second IOS is closed source meaning they could be hiding telemetry and spyware and we wouldn't know it, android has the benifit of being from my understanding semi open source but they have the same problem as apple as not giving a fuck about your settings, If you install lineage OS with microg however, It will be android but with all of the privacy invasive things actually turned off and you will be able to download from the play store without actually giving google information.	
4873	 xuqmiqoxe	 Buy an iPod, plug the iPod into a radio speaker/alarm clock speaker so it can be always charged and you can hear when it rings. Connect the iPod to your WiFi at home and then install Sudo. Get a number from Sudo and give it out to people. 	
4874	 JustaReverseFridge	 are you in a privacy subreddit using an unsecured and non private operating system and suprised that this happened? Wipe your phone, Install lineage with microg and leave it at that	
4875	 xuqmiqoxe	 I believe I read a while back that there is a cookie that Facebook uses to track you while you are using different websites within the same browser session. So if that's still the case and this cookie exists, it's possible that while you were logged in (if you didn't clean out cookies when you navigated away/closed the tab) that they tracked you as you visited your Gmail or maybe even you went to your therapist's website to login and check on scheduled sessions/etc. 	
4876	 TibetanBowlHealing	 Same with all the NSA vulnerabilities exposed by Snowden. Those were years old and just the tip of the iceberg when he leaked them. Your devices may have locks, but the government always has the key.

4883	 sting_12345	 Definitely true and possible but from the court cases and their public stance bitching so much I don't think the FBI and DEA are that tricky.  I do believe apple 64 bit phones present them a big challenge when 'cop mode' is triggered on iOS 11.  We don't know what version he was using, maybe he doesn't keep updates because he's paranoid?  Local LEO and FBI/DEA/DOJ I htink have no idea how to get into a properly secured device.  The CIA/NSA a lotdifferent story and why this new FISA renewal sucks so bad.

4888	 merger3	 Really Lineage is supported on almost every flagship phone. Do some research, just about everything from Google, Samsung, and LG are supported and many other mainstream devices as well.If money is a problem look at refurbs. Especially after the Christmas season many refurbs are returned gifts and practically new.	
4889	 merger3	 Many people are a bit extreme and say both platforms should be avoided at all costs. While they aren't necessarily wrong, there some differences between them.Out of the box, iOS is better than Android. Not only does Android track you incredibly aggressively, there are some reports that they just ignore settings tweaks. Google also makes a large part of its revenue off ad money so they have no incentive to block trackers.Apple is not great for your privacy, but it isn't as aggressive as Google. For one thing, Apple helps block external (read non-Apple) trackers as they have an incentive to block them (no major ad business and direct hit to competitors). IPhones are also extremely secure and virtually impossible to hack unless you give your password away. Android has more customization at the cost of more risk.Of course, Android has the advantage of being able to install custom Tom's, which is the best thing you can do, but in a vanilla match up, go for Apple. Just keep in mind it isn't really private, it's just a bit better than stock Android.

4891	 merger3	 Mega is better than most things. Keep in mind the golden rule though, if it's not on servers you host or it's not encrypted, it's not really private.Mega is still way better than iClould, Google Drive, Dropbox, etc though.

4898	 skidmark-steve	 I got a Zenfone 2. Can't beat the specs for the $160 price! (64GB nand and 4GB memory)Many phones in this price range are half that. Also, MicroSD slot! But no user-swapable battery, sadly.Whatever you choose, be careful. Make sure it supports unlocking the boot loader! Not every phone of a given model does. For example, take the Moto G. The more expensive ones support unlocking the boot loader, but Amazon is offering them with lock screen ads for a lower price... and a boot loader that can't be unlocked, meaning no Lineage OS on the one with ads! Another example is the old Note 4. Most Note 4's can run custom ROMS, but the AT&amp;T model still can't, because nobody has figured out how to unlock the boot loader. So always do research before buying any given device.	
4899	 AtBios	 Can someone tell me why he said it is not trustworthy? Plus, didn't he say that like 5 versions ago? Just thinking if something has changed and they have better privacy now.

4905	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; Apps like Signal or Whatsapp have encryption, but no deniability. You are mistaken, [Signal explicitly has deniability](https://signal.org/blog/simplifying-otr-deniability/). If you prefer not to use Signal, you can always use OTR, which also has deniability. Your post however sounds like what you are looking for is *anonymity*, not (or alongside with) *deniability*. In which case you can have your chat client connect through Tor (for example you can connect to a secure XMPP server using a chat client like Pidgin through Tor, and then use OTR for the chat session, so you'll have both anonymity and deniability).

4948	 AtBios	 Do you have issues with the syncing? I imported my OPML file from another service and marked everything as read (from the start so I wouldn't get notified for every single old article I already read.:D ). However, now it takes several minutes for the RSS Feed to update at DisRoot. When logging into my old services I see 5 new articles, but in DisRoot I see no new ones, and I did check so I didn't accidently mark them as read. They are just not imported updated yet, even after forcing. Do you know if that is an issue? I mean, I will still change even if it is slower to update my Feeds, but wanted to check if the problem was just for me.

4953	 thibaultmartin	 The refreshing of the feeds server side is triggered by a cron job.The service you are using is NextCloud, and especialle Nextcloud News. Disroot hosts an instance of NextCloud. It is very likely that the cron job does not run every couple of minutes in order to save resources.For the average person who consults his/her feeds once or twice a day, it is more then enough.If you need a more reactive service, you can install your own nextcloud instance and configure a cron job to run more often. This is quite much work though.Alternatively you might want to give Tiny Tiny RSS (TTRSS) a try, though it looks a bit old.

Threema has a good concept but it isn't open source.  Eleet formed it's own crypto based on TextSecure's and their site has no privacy policy, terms of service, and their project is also closed source.  Wickr is decent.  Wire (you didn't mention this one) is a good messenger that relies on security for it's platform and uses a strong crypto system.

Their crypto, while non-standard, still doesn't show any issues as far as I'm aware. They have a bounty on their encryption, too. The issue with them is that they don't E2E encrypt all messages.I also think OP is seriously misinformed on Telegram:&gt; Telegram - Russian security officials projectThe Durov brothers, while not entirely trustworthy, are much more trustworthy than Russian officials. Furthermore, the Durov brothers have been living in self appointed exile because of the problems they have with their native country.

4977	 PrivacyRabbit	 To respond to your VPN question:Using a VPN is always a good idea if you care about privacy, although I would advise against using a VPN such asZenMate, or similar, as they often log your activity and have been known to leak your IP. Use a VPN service that has a 0 logs policy; NordVPN and PrivateInternetAccess are examples.Do your research when looking for a VPN, don't just go for the first one you see.

That said, most MDMs offer a selective wipe feature, especially if the expectation is that you install it on a personal device. This way, corporate info should stay within the sandbox, and they wipe only that portion of the phone.

5026	 skidmark-steve	 First, you are assigned a randomly generated, unique advertising ID. Many consumer hostile platforms do this today, not just Windows. There is another unique ID tied to you, that being the product key.Windows 10 gathers plenty of encrypted data about you. You can't switch it all off either. It isn't out of the question that the above IDs are being (or eventually will be) used to track you around the web, the way that Google tracks you if you let them plant persistent cookies in the browser. Microsoft would be foolish not to do this, especially as Bing continues to grow. Microsoft would get an advantage, because that product key of Windows is always uniquely tied to you.	
5027	 AnonymousAurele	 Does the iOS [App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/newsblur/id463981119?mt=8) fetch feeds standalone, or does it require a linked external cloud provider?	
5028	 AnonymousAurele	 Maybe enabling [Signal integration](https://signal.org/blog/skype-partnership/) would help.  A way to bring this up would be to ask the hiring manager if you could interview via “Microsoft’s new [Private Conversations](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34824/what-are-private-conversations-in-the-new-skype) feature in Skype”.

5036	 _kusochi	 Yeah I know about the medium mode, but it doesn't provide the functionality I need. See my explanation [here](https://reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7qaygm/blocking_only_3rd_party_tracking_scripts/dsot70y?context=3).Medium mode blocks all 3rd party domains but I would like to allow tracking that isn't like Google analytics which is big centralised and tracks across all sites. I'm am fine with individual sites tracking me on their site if the they use their own self hosted analytics like Piwik. This makes sure they have only the data from my visit on their site and no one else like Google has the data.	
5037	 Somnambulant_Sudoku	 We [the general public] don't have all of the facts. But when every single intelligence agency says "yes, Russia was involved in manipulating the elections," When facebook, twitter and other are submitting evidence to a congressional review which also asserts this, and When meetings that were not properly reported to the FBI between the inner circle of Trump's campaign and Russian diplomats very close to Vladimir Putin are coming to light, There's a whole lot of smoke for there not to be some fire as well.I'm not saying there was any collusion; I don't have the proof I would need to say that, However, it looks pretty damning from what is public knowledge so far.___Full disclosure: I did not vote for Trump, and I disagree with many of his policy decisions, but I also don't think there's enough evidence (unless more comes to light) for there to be an actual case for impeachment. 	
5038	 mooms01	 &gt; I'm am fine with individual sites tracking me on their site if the they use their own self hosted analytics like Piwik.Then it will not be blocked in medium mode. Learn to use it, it's very flexible.	
5039	 _kusochi	 It will be blocked if the site has their analytics hosted on different domain. I know how to use the medium mode as I used it for quite a while and I know it doesn't know which domains the company behind the site owns. But one other commenter told that Privacy Badger provides the more "relaxed" way of blocking which is what I was looking for.

5049	 PrivacyRabbit	 As you've mentioned [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/), I'll go with that. Protonmail is a extremely secure and private email provider, with end-to-end encryption. I'd recommend it for the following reasons:* ProtonMail is incorporated in Switzerland and all their servers are located in Switzerland. This means all user data is protected by strict Swiss privacy laws. * It's mainly open source, with only the back-end closed for the obvious reasons.* It's easy to use. If you buy the reasonably priced **plus** plan, you can add a custom domain address, as well as having up to 5 personal protonmail address.	
5050	 btcltcbch	 &gt; TPTBDoes that mean fake news AKA CNN/Some Democrats? first time I hear of that and [UD](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TPTB) didn't help me much but English is not my first language and it might be why...I really wish Bernie Sanders would have won and we would not be in this mess.	
5051	 australian_user	 While I like ProtonMail, OP wants header data encrypted. ProtonMail doesn't encrypt subject lines.	
5052	 btcltcbch	 Russians paid for a few ads.. what proportion of the total number of ads? My guess would be about 1 millionth of 1 percent... considering how many Clinton ads I had to watch....	
5053	 PrivacyRabbit	 You bring up a good point. Although Protonmail doesn't encrypt said data so as to adhere to PGP, making you able to send encrypted messages to non-protonmail users. It's a case of privacy vs. functionality. 	
5054	 Lasterba	 The powers that be.	
5055	 australian_user	 You're not going to be able to split a domain between two mail servers. The best option would be to create a subdomain, eg secure.domain.com then have you@secure.domain.com so you can keep the existing domain pointed where it is.ProtonMail has a couple million users, with users pointing nearly 5000 custom domains to them. They're probably big enough now that you're not a target. Paid accounts have IMAP for Windows/Mac, however only email body is encrypted - subject lines are not (so they're searchable on the web client).Running your own mail server has a bunch of problems, like dealing with spam/blocklists and building your server's trust.

5061	 NordicJesus	 What would be the advantage of using Nextcloud over SpiderOak?I don't care much about efficiency, there wouldn't be a lot of data uploaded anyway.I don't need access to my files from my phone, only from my computer.I only want to use the cloud storage for backup as my phone was recently stolen I lost a couple hours' worth of photos and videos.I always move my photos/videos from my phone to my computer when I connect it anyway, so I really only use it as a camera.The reason I was thinking of SpiderOak+Boxcryptor was that both are supposed to offer "zero knowledge" (end-to-end encryption), and I figured that if combined two products, even if one should be compromised, there would still be a second layer of protection.I want to be able to store very private files there without losing sleep.Thanks!	
5062	 australian_user	 Always! If you’re comfortable with the trade off then go for it. I think ProtonMail is a good solution. My email is split between ProtonMail and an Icelandic webhost (I don’t leave my mail on their server). Depending on whom I’m dealing with depends on the address I give out. 	
5063	 NordicJesus	 But how strict is Swiss privacy law really? As far as I know they don't even have secure banking anymore.	
5064	 NordicJesus	 While not ideal, I think I could live with non-encrypted subject lines, as long as IP addresses are stripped off and there are other benefits.But yes, I would definitely prefer encrypted headers, as long as I can use Thunderbird locally for searching my email.

5068	 PrivacyRabbit	 You may want to take a look here: https://protonmail.com/blog/switzerland/	
5069	 NordicJesus	 I don't want to change my email address(es).Speaking of which, I just remembered I also use a second domain for catchall purposes (someservice.com@myseconddomain.com) - makes it easier to filter out spam. But I guess that shouldn't be an issue as that domain is exclusively used by me.But I guess I could forward email to my "family" email address to a Protonmail mailbox (hoping that my ISP does not keep copies - which probably is a little bit too much hoping)?	
5070	 mst3kcrow	 I am a fairly strong privacy advocate but right now the biggest threat isn't domestic surveillance, it's the fact that the GOP has been compromised by the FSB/KGB.  Globally, our biggest long term threat is probably climate change and resource security.Edit:  Fuck off Putinbots	
5071	 PrivacyRabbit	 Nextcloud is self-hosted (although you can use recommended hosting providers), therefore you can see everything that's going on with you data. It's really up to you, SpiderOak + Boxcryptor will work fine as long as you're okay with the occasional loss of efficiency, both are secure and private methods, it really just comes down to preference. I realise this probably wasn't the answer you were looking for but I hope I've helped :)

5083	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Its so important for people to see what you say here.If anyone thinks the government wouldnt do the same to a movement of now that threatened to challenge the current power paradigm, that person is very mistaken. Governments have done this repeatedly throughout history- and it can get much worse.Government should never be trusted- it should always be feared and always treated as hostile to Liberty. Don't let anyone strongarm you into believing you are paranoid for distrust of government, and don't let government tell you what needs to be done. We all are currently watching them destroy our 4th amendment rights, but you had best believe they will only come for more and more the more they succeed.

5090	 AFuckYou	 And it diddnt work. Then he was fucking "assassinated" by a "white supremacist" with a bomb (edit murdered by guns not bombed, his house was bombed though)  that no normal citizen had access to. After the FBI had personally threatened him, wire tapped him, and the cops that were on a 24/7 protection denial were mysteriously ordered to go grab some doughnuts. Wouldent it be wierd if the US government was some kind of corrupt organization, through and through. And they committed some kind of genocide of dissidents that started out small but turned out to be large scale by the 2020s? And no one noticed because it was committed by local police, FBI, and CIA under the guise of racial hate, suicide, mental disorder, and etc etc etc.Gosh, wouldent that be crazy. It's not like it's happing right under your nose.Edit: this is the first time I have ever seen a "conspiracy theory", aka the truth or history not told in lies, upvoted. I realize that if you look at what happened, it is clear that he was assassinated by the US government.But people generally hide from the truth. Because the government has successfully run a negative campaign against the term "conspiracy theory". When in reaility we see cops commit criminal conspiracies on tape video and audio all the time. My point is that are people actually waking up. Are you all becoming aware of what's going on with your money. Your tax payer money. Why are you up voting me? Usually I get alot of hate. If your woke, be careful who you speak to. The harder you push, the more people they will kill. No joke. You corner a wolf and it will attack. They will fight to maintain power.Never let people know you know unless you are sure they are not corrupt. You need to make up a smart test to know. You can automatically rule out and drug dealers, cops, government officials, etc. Be safe and remember the Internet is not anonymous.

5096	 Deprawachujator	 I'm glad, OP, that you've brought this up. What you're describing is essentially me. I have no existing records of my existence (no passports, licences, registered property, tax returns, online accounts, credit cards, you name it)... the last time I even had my photograph taken was prior to the advent of digital photography... so I've been doing this for a long, long time. So let me give you my perspective.The number one thing one needs to live like this is mental discipline, specifically mastery over one's ego.No amount of privacy apps or Opsec or what-have-you will work unless one can resist giving information to where information is sought. In today's age, that's mostly the internet, but there are others if one thinks about it for a few minutes. Discipline  will also serve one well for all other aspects of keeping private, from thinking twice before speaking to resisting foolish impulses. From most people, I get the impression this may be difficult. Yes, but all worthwhile endeavors are.... but it gets easier with practice, and soon it becomes second nature.The number two most important thing is a good case of sang-froid. By that I mean a willingness to leave it all behind on a moment's notice: possessions, relationships, jobs, everything. I've done it twice before moving to a new jurisdiction. I expect this would be even harder for most people... either one can do it or not, I don't see this as a trait that can be practiced. If one has these two traits, then I think one may be able to embark "the Shadow journey." As far as maintaining online privacy... well go no further than reading this sub if you absolutely must have an electronic life. As far as privacy in the physical world, I would highly recommend J. J. Luna's "How to be Invisible."Having said that, I've also been very fortunate to have been born with a strong sense of independence, patience, and ingenuity. I also happen to live in a liberal western democracy where I'm free to do as I please... I may very well be the freest person on the planet!

Great!And indeed, if you've got a good trust relationship with your neighbour, VPN is not really needed.

Government is necessary and a way for a society to organize.  The problem are unaccountable government bureaucrats.  Therefore, as technology and knowledge advance, we need to be constantly evolving our laws to enable more people to have power to improve their lives.  The absence of accountability is a major problem we deal with in the U.S., not having "too much" government.

You may stay alive, but what fucking kind of life is that? If I honestly believed what you said in the post, I would either begin to wage a war against the government tomorrow or go to a different country. All this shit about a coherent government conspiracy from the 50's on is fucking ridiculous. Look how unorganized pur government members are, how often they change, who stays in power (talking businesses here too). There is no fucking way that they could have a cohesive plan that they stick to as a group with absolutely nobody finding out. 'Woke?' Wake the fuck up and face reality. And I just want to reiterate; if you aren't willing to fight for your freedom and for the truth, you deserve neither. Edit: I do want to clarify that I think the government did have a hand in MLK's death. They have done numerous things that are fucking detestable and indefensible.

You would rather have your family member's account un-protected? In order for us to even begin to try and help, we would have to know why you think these emails need to be protected and from whom. You have to understand that when it comes to confidentiality, email is a poor communication tool. There are superior alternatives like (Signal and Wire) that provides end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy. If all you are looking for is a mailbox that encrypts the user's email with a key provided by the user, then maybe  Protonmail or Tutanota would work for you.

So now fucking think about it. 	
5173	 cas18khash	 So you're in favor of 'governance' while the person you replied to is against state sovereignty. I don't think they'll argue against the need to organize a nation. Just that when you proclaim the state to be sovereign, you're basically giving away your liberty. That's why I agree with both of you. The philosophy of nation states (less than 400 years old) is inherently based on violence and coercion and isn't sustainable. No nation state has been formed without a war or without being the conclusion of a war. We need to decouple large scale governance away from sovereign nation states because nation states by design take away liberty from some.

5185	 brennanfee	 &gt; Look at the ratios of the dems vs repubs voting for this. It's a minority of dems of voted for it. It's a large majority of repubs.Only because of the makeup of Congress at the moment.  If Dems had the majority than the majority voting for it would have been Dems.  They want these powers every bit as much as the right... don't kid yourself.Like I said.  The Dems are better but they are no angels... not that we should be seeking angels.  There are any number of policies that they put forward that are against what the people want.  The issue I'm describing is truly bi-partisan.  That one side is slightly better but not perfect doesn't mean that I don't care which side wins.&gt; You're worthless and it's ignorant voters like you that are part of the problem.I voted for Hilary dude, calm down.  I didn't want her in the race but when it comes down to bad and worse I vote for bad.  Ignorance is about not knowing what is going on and you embody that more than I at this point.  I prefer the Dems but that doesn't mean that what they do isn't every bit as much for their donors... it's just they have better donors.  In a democracy the representatives are supposed to represent the people... their constituents.  Not their donors.  Because I am aware that both sides are beholden doesn't mean I'm ignorant... it means I'm able to compromise for the best we can get given the corruption we have allowed to overtake our system.

Yeah, there is A TON of shit wrong with the US. Yes, a shit ton of politicians are corrupt crooks. But to believe that they are working cooperatively is asinine. The 'system' is what you truly need to fight. There's not some ultra-neo-nazi supremacist giving  orders to kill the minorities anywhere in the US; there is a system that allows people to *get away* with things like what you mentioned because they are not punished properly, therefore never setting a precedent that can be followed when similar crimes are committed, leaving a jurisdictional black hole. And you know who's to blame? EVERY SINGLE FUCKING AMERICAN. We put these guys there, only we can remove them. Remove the corrupt, replace with just, change the system. *That's* how you see positive change happen in a democracy. Not by hiding out because you're too fucking scared of the consequences. Although they are our natural rights, freedom and liberty are not things you are born with; you have to fight for them just like every single fucking person on this planet. As soon as fools like you have influence over enlightened people, we fail. Because if we fail to stand up to what is wrong in our country, our country will never be right again. So yeah, I call you a fucking coward who is too scared to face the problems you see. Instead you hide out, spouting nonsense that discourages *anyone* from making meaningful strides towards change. Shame on you.

5190	 cas18khash	 You could be neoliberal all you want but if you explicitly or implicitly support a Nazi apologist, you're close. Read 'Banality of Evil'. People who helped the Nazi cause the most where the ones who were thinking of their career and just wanted to succeed in climbing the ladder of success and getting recognized by their peers. Got that? The best Nazis didn't feel any special sort of way about The Final Solution.This is why people are mad at the moderate right in America. They're using this shit show as their career take-off platform, while ignoring the crimes being done in their name. The fear is that if trump were to truly become authoritarian, then these right wingers would feel safe to push all the way right because it'd be career suicide not to at that point. We've heard of middle managers becoming concentration camp guards so they could later become governors.	
5191	 FinnishCobweb	 If the provider of your operating system is a threat to you then the logical thing is to stay away from it. Depending on your situation, this may not be possible, however you can mitigate a lot more of the risks here by simply compartmentalizing.	
5192	 nonbelligerentmoron	 The people who need to see this the most are the sjws who act like they want a more authoritarian government with powers to censor and police people.

5194	 cas18khash	 It's true. People think of the deep state as some sort of smokey room with 6 people in it, playing chess. But in reality there is hundreds of those rooms, in every institution of the state, in every level of influence, under every presidency.The state wants to make fun of Chomsky and them who talk of deep state collusion and make it seem tin foil hatty to diverge from and normalize small scale nepotism and gross misuse of the powers of your office.It's fucked.

5198	 AFuckYou	 You are smart. Most people don't realize it's not a billionaire telling a cop to shoot some one. It's an operation by a head with 6 people under him. Then six people under them. So on and such till you get  to cop or a judge or a lawyer or a banker or an undertaker or a goverment offical pr a dock inspector that is either paid off or has been put into a compromising situation or was born into the game. Most participants don't realize what they are apart of and how deep it goes. They don't realize that the surveillance they are committing to will end up in that persons death, or disappearance or destruction of their family. They simply know that they owe whoever a favor and this is it. After that favor they are "blooded" in and under threat of death, prosecution, fear, or willing participation they are a silent participant from that act on out.People don't realize this is a game that has been played for longer than our grandparents lives. It's an institution. It's the black market. The heads have been heads for as long as it has existed. And they have played this game, and they know the rules, since before we existed. I'm not talking about some new thing that has come about two years ago.

Maybe we can steer you in the right direction."it seems like I've already lost all my privacy"While i cant speak for anyone else in this thread but i know i have."I want to start taking measures to secure my privacy but I don't know where to start from. It doesn't help that I rely on Youtube for my income, as a result I have to maintain my online persona on other social platforms too. I try not to give away personal information at all when surfing the web and have considerably reduced using the internet apart from when I need to use it for "work". I honestly feel stuck and this stresses me out a lot."This is the problem a lot of people run into. It is impossible to protect yourself from all threats. What you need to learn is the principles of operation security and compartmentalization. Once you have an understanding of what is an actual threat to you, then you can focus on that, and not stress over hypothetical nonsense. You say that Youtube is your source of income which means it is tied to your real identity. You also have social media accounts to help market your channel. What is the threat here? The only problem i can see here is if you use your real name for your channel brand and you are worried about someone taking offense to something you said and finding out where you live. No one can really help you without first understanding what risks you are trying to mitigate.

5218	 cl3ft	 It's fine for you to describe a country you had a negative experience in as a shithole, it's your opinion and it's worth exactly nothing and hurts no one.It's not ok for the leader of arguably the most powerful country in the world to do so. It has repercussions. It feeds racism and hatred and disempowers already disempowered people. Most Americans can trace their roots back to countries that would at the time have been considered "shiholes" in your vernacular.Don't excuse him for this it reflects your ignorance of the gravity of what he did.	
5219	 5878	 How’s that working out?	
5220	 FinnishCobweb	 In what context? By design, your phone actually needs to be "monitored" in order to use some of it's functionalities. If you mean surveillance, then it depends on who is doing surveilling. If you have strong reasons to believe your phone is bugged, then the most sane thing to do is throw it away. Then again, if your adversary knows you are aware of their present, then that may actually put you in more danger than you already were.	
5221	 nonbelligerentmoron	 its perfectly fine. People are just looking to judge cuz it feels good. Stating objective facts is always perfectly fine. Its not my opinion that they are shitholes, *they are the literal definition of complete and absolute shitholes* and most the people with power in those countries have 1000x worse morals than Trump.  No I think it reflects your ignorance of how allowing the establishment to manufacture consent with fake outrage is 10000000000000000000000000x more dangerous than DrumpfI am not a trump supporter, I just know a pointless distraction when I see one.

5228	 NotoriousArab	 The leader of the most powerful country in the world is supposed to show respect and diplomacy, as to set an example for the rest of the world. Yes, those counties may be "shitholes", however, it does not make it appropriate to call them that publicly. Just like how you see an overweight person and think they're fat, but you don't go yelling it in their face.

5230	 btcltcbch	 J. Edgar Hoover would have loved the NSA	
5231	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I think "trust" and "necessary" is different. I don't really think we disagree with one another actually (bear with me); you citing the need for accountability- which is accomplished with transparency- inherently says that government is not to be *trusted* (even though it is still *necessary*) and thus requires transparency/accountability. I 99% agree with your reply. We absolutely need our laws to keep pace with technology otherwise that technology will be used as an instrument of oppression against the People.The only 1% I disagree with: that "too much" government isn't a problem. It *is* a problem, but one of many. There are certain areas where I think government needs to be "bigger" than it is now i.e. financial regulation, corporate regulation, ability to revoke a corporations charter, the ability to prevent corporations from ripping off the government via ridiculous contracts, the ability of government to more readily peak into corporate entities, etc. Other areas I think we need "smaller" government i.e. revamping a ridiculous intellectual property law system, reducing red tape that stifles small business competitors from competing with large corporations, an NSA/CIA that is used defensively against foreign actors instead of offensively against American citizens, a non imperialist foreign policy, etc etc.But we do absolutely agree about transparency and accountability, so lets celebrate what we agree on rather than argue over the stuff we dont- I think *adopting this mindset* is **crucial** to our citizenry making any progress at protecting their rights and reforming our system. 	
5232	 nonbelligerentmoron	 I completely agree but in the context of the media freaking out about this instead of Trumps ties to wall street Im giving him a pass. Im going to ignore 100% of the racist things he says because all of that is a distraction. 	
5233	 wertperch	 Fingers bloody crossed!	
5234	 JeffersonsSpirit	 That *sort of* depends on your definition of what quartering a soldier means.One could make a solid argument that an Echo or google Home is a soldier- whenever the state wants it to be. Its true that it doesn't own a weapon nor can it forcibly change your activity in the home, but it can retrieve all sorts of information about you, cause you to sub-consciously self-censor, etc.	
5235	 altogether_elsewhere	 In this case the FBI actually found out that Dr. King was cheating on his wife and sent him an anonymous letter encouraging him to commit suicide. ([Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBI%E2%80%93King_suicide_letter))	
5236	 cddupr	 I think that there's a cynical, popular acceptance of there being a false equivalency between the republicans and democrats.  It's toxic and people need to be mindful of how that overlooks legitimate efforts to prevent corruption.  I am sorry for being hostile, and I respect the point you're making.  But  it's a lack of solidarity among liberals that is at least partly responsible for what has happened.  If all the noise is filtered out, all the bullshit news, look at what the dems stand for.  Take Citizens United, a transparent vote for or against corruption in politics; party line split and dems were against money in politics.That's the point.  You say dems want power just as much as the right but it's just not true, not in any meaningful sense.  If you make the argument that efforts to enact environmental protections, or consumer protections, or affordable health care are somehow just attempts to seize power then you have a warped perspective.  When you say that when dems are in power, the people don't get what they want - if you consider that the dems have consistently tried to apply policies that benefit the public overall, then your statement just isn't true. It isn't.

5246	 An0nym17y	 In my experience, leftists are often defined as the people who are the identity-politics driven SJWs.

5251	 03fusc8	 Sooo... just like Trump?	
5252	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Guns are a check on power because they make the cost of subjugating a population by force significantly higher. Even if- *if*- your military could win in an all out rebellion with an armed population, the cost would be absolutely catastrophic. In a way, even if a tyrant wanted to take control of an armed people, he would effectively bankrupt the country in the process of trying to do so.Having arms are a natural deterrent to authoritarianism... which is why they have repeatedly been taken from the people by tyrants of the past under whatever pretense they can manage to sell.If guns sat around America never being used- and I acknowledge that unfortunately we are not this peaceful and thus this is not so- they would still have significant value for what they *could be* if the people decided to employ them.You are seeing the benefits of no firearms in the short run without- IMO and without any disrespect intended- acknowledging that there is a long run scenario and that they have value there. Chemotherapy is hell in the short run, but its a price many pay for a hope at benefit on the long run; to avoid chemotherapy means to suffer less in the short run, but fare much worse in the long run.

5263	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I wrote a long drawn out reply to a comment that has since been deleted. I wont post the user's name, but I will post his reply and my reply to him:&gt; Well said. What do you think is the most efficient (ie, open &amp; real-time vs FOIA requests) way to get to transparency (which is needed in order to hold members of gov accountable)?I don't have a perfect answer. You cannot eliminate the shadows completely- you can only shine light where it is possible given the current level of technology (and given the People's willingness to deploy that technology on behalf of governmental transparency). There is always a dark room somewhere, an encrypted phone call, etc. I think the first step is to significantly reduce the *incentive* for corruption. To briefly explain why, consider an example. You've got a disastrous amount of mosquitos in your yard. You can go buy citronella candles, OFF, those tiki style lamps, mosquito nets, wear pants, etc etc. Or, you can remove the 150 water filled old tires you've allowed to accumulate in your backyard.One aspect of our government's corruption is heavily corporate. You can try stuffing cameras in every room, deploying drones to follow cars to track the movement of government officials, deploy hackers to hack government computers, etc etc and you still won't put a dent in corruption; all your candles and OFF cans arent going to solve your issue. The most effective way is to reform campaign finance (or eliminate/equalize it), reform corporate lobbying, reform intellectual property laws (which allows corporate entities to form monopolies that can bend government to its will), etc etc; by removing the water filled tires, you cut the source of mosquitos, or in this case corruption.I am in favor of term limits.Once you've greatly lessened the motivation, *then* you can much more easily and plausibly manage open and real-time methods of transparency.In terms of open and real time analysis, I think I would target individual greed to work *for* the citizenry, and thus make corruption much less profitable. What do I mean? Target the people who are able to *see* the corruption with incentives to expose that corruption. Whistleblowers. Incentivize the hell out of it. This is the only solid advice I have in terms of real time scanning actually- who better than the experts in the trenches to expose corruption? They know what they're seeing, they know if its illegal, and they're going to know how to expose it. Whistleblower protection laws are one step towards helping them, while actual financial payouts for whistleblowers *who expose illegal corruption, cronyism, etc* are another. Payouts of a significant size- along with the social reward of being respected for exposing corruption- would increase the amount of money/power/whatever that corrupt-ers would need to pay, and thus would lower the profitability of corruption (and thus the prevalence of it).In terms of cameras and all that- thats tough. Your enemies are going to use this information against you as well. This sort of real-time analysis I think requires a shift in the dominant narrative of the *world's* geopolitics. I would try working with extranational organizations (say the UN or whatever) to *encourage* the dispersion of openness, whistleblower protections, etc, but I would shy from giving them any *power* directly- they would then become the vector of corruption. In many ways, this is like asking Nuclear powers to give up their nukes- its a long and drawn out process.	
5264	 iamnewtothisstuff	 Which political movement in the US got further because of guns?Women (voting)? Slaves? Indians? Edit: Gay movement.They only needed guns to protect them against the other armed citizens.

5269	 JeffersonsSpirit	 And even though I support the right to bear arms, I truly wish they *all* sat around not being used. If this were so, there would be no short-run negative effect, and yet the long-run benefits of deterring government oppression would still be there.Alas, that is not the case. Gun's are used in crime all across the US, but to say they only have this cost without also citing their long-run benefit is to fail in seeing the whole picture. Yes, they have a cost, but they also have a benefit.

5274	 [deleted]	 [removed]	
5275	 JeffersonsSpirit	 The Civil War comes to mind. In that case, the South had less political power, less material power, less soldiers, etc and they *still* dominated early because of *their men knowing better how to use guns.* Yes, the South's cause wasn't just (IMO). Yes they lost. But the point is still illustrated- they were at a disadvantage in every way and yet still turned it into a serious fight. Perhaps in the future the disadvantaged side will have a just cause? We can only hope they win in that case...Please don't misinterpret: I'm all for peaceful paths forward. I'm absolutely glad that women's rights and civil rights were won (mostly) peacefully without large-scale bloody rebellion.But really- perhaps those battles were won precisely because we weren't as corrupt as we could have been were we more easily subjugated by tyrannical powers.Think of it this way: the US government didn't plan to fix Iraq or Afghanistan by dropping voter ballots in by helicopter (not that I supported these actions- I didn't- but bear with me). Pieces of paper are useless unless the government recognizes them, and only if the candidates on the ballots aren't all tyrants. They used the US military to try and effect change by throwing out the existing government and replacing it with a different one.And arms on the other side played a role as well. A ragtag band of random assorted individuals with a fraction of US weaponry have given us hell for 15+ years. And this where the US has all of its supply and manufacturing infrastructure untouched...Im not saying that its desirable or necessarily successful to engage in armed conflict with a government- just that the prospect of such a conflict serves as a  disincentive to tyranny, and that a future people who feels something that extreme is necessary are past the point of paper making any difference... and thus should have the option. Hopefully it never comes to that.	
5276	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I'm not sure if you're being nice or sarcastic- its reddit so it can be hard to tell, lol. But in the event that you are being nice, I will say this: people generally fear what they don't understand or what they don't control.If everyone in the home is afraid of guns, show them how the gun works and bring them along to a shooting range so they can practice control of the gun. When home, securely store the guns so they are not dangerous to those who don't have the necessary level of responsibility yet (kids, etc). If you're being sarcastic, we'll have to just agree to disagree :)	
5277	 ReverendWilly	 I’m being serious. And I’ve offered to take the wife to the range, I’ve had a navy master st arms offer to do basic safety training, etc, but it’s always a firm “no.” One of the kids “owns” a .22 but the rifle doesn’t live in the house. He has a classic Red Ryder in the house. It’s silly, but I’d rather have a wife than an armory...	
5278	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Yeah, well everyone is different. There is a stigma attached to firearms- for some it is based more in feeling than logic I think. Some people who smoke buy by the pack- they dont want to commit to a carton- even though a carton is cheaper. I think this sort of parallels gun ownership for some- to purchase, own, or practice with a gun is to commit to the notion they may one day use it. That is not desirable to them (and I mean really its not to anyone), so they avoid it.But I get it- in your situation, I wouldn't push it either. We have to respect the wishes of our SOs/wives/husbands/lovers/friends. Offer and if they have no interest, you just accept that they aren't comfortable and move on. That applies to guns, privacy invading crap, supporting tyrannical governments, etc etc.	
5279	 PrivacyRabbit	 You do make a good point, which is why using a hosting provider you trust is important. If self-hosting is off the table I'd go for the spideroak option.	
5280	 toper-centage	 Actually, it's been shown that even if phones are "off" they often have low power processes running. Simple example is the feature to schedule turning the phone on in the morning, or ring the alarm even if the phone is off. It's not a stretch to imagine the network layer to be usable in that state as well. 	
5281	 NordicJesus	 Yes. They're happy that they can use their last name as part of their email address, and the alternative would be to GMail etc., which wouldn't be any more secure. They can call the email provider when there is trouble ("I need to undelete an email!") and it's cheap. Works very well. And they "have nothing to hide" (quote unquote).I on the other hand am a technical user and care about my privacy. I just don't want anyone going through my email. (I bet GMail uses IP information from email headers for location tracking.)Tutanota I'm not so sure about as they are located in Germany, which isn't such a great jurisdiction. Guess I will try Protonmail, I just need to figure out how to make this work with my setup...	
5282	 NordicJesus	 Thanks! I guess SpiderOak it is then.Would I be able to get file history, even when using Boxcryptor?How would I set up an automatic backup with Boxcryptor?(Maybe I should just forget about Boxcryptor, except for super sensitive files, and just use the regular SpiderOak One features?)

5284	 NordicJesus	 Thanks, that looks pretty good.It's interesting that Posteo comes out so well in the comparison - being German myself, I wouldn't trust a German email provider.I already use PGP (Thunderbird + Enigmail).	
5285	 NordicJesus	 I just realized that if header information is accessible, they can see who I emailed. If the other person uses a regular insecure provider, they can just read my email in their account instead.Damn. But Protonmail sounds so good otherwise...	
5286	 clearly_clear	 How to fix:  Install linux mint.  or elementary.  or ubuntu.  There are many user friendly options today.	
5287	 FinnishCobweb	 I still don't understand why you would approach it this way. If what you said is true about them not having anything to hide, then why not let them use gmail instead? It is very unlikely that whatever email solution you have for them right now would match the information security talent, and network infrastructure of Google. I'm not trying to dismiss the fact the Google monetize off its user's emails. For free, they offer strong confidentiality and ease of use for any skill level. Fastmail is a email service provider that is not in the business of selling ads. They might be a good option for you. I can only conclude that what you are really looking for is a mailbox that can only be access with the user provided key and not the server's. Though i dont know what kind of emails you would be receiving that would warrant such protection. Remember, most email providers scan ingress and egress emails for spam. Tracking via IP address makes no sense. There are easier ways to do stuff like that.	
5288	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
5289	 NordicJesus	 I don't understand why you are suddenly focusing on my family's email addresses. Nothing will change for them, why should I make them use GMail when they are happy with what they have? All they want is a regular email inbox with IMAP support. Of course my webhoster does not sell their data. It's just not encrypted, admins can access it etc. - but that's a good thing for them because they tend do screw things up, and then somebody can help them (and I don't have to do it).Yes, you are correct, I am looking for a mailbox that can only be accessed with my key. "What do you need privacy for, do you have something to hide?" is a very weird argument to make in a subreddit on privacy.	
5290	 NordicJesus	 So, in contrast to Posteo, Protonmail does not store the private key on their servers. Which is why they can only offer IMAP through their IMAP Bridge.Would I be able to run the IMAP Bridge on a separate server, in Iceland for instance?I'd like to keep using the iOS email client...	
5291	 FinnishCobweb	 I'm not trying to say you shouldn't have privacy. I just see way many people on here try  to implement solutions that doesn't actually solve anything and lead them into to false sense of security. Try out protonmail, it maybe the lowest entry bar to what you need.	
5292	 NordicJesus	 I work as a software developer, so I have a good technical understanding.Protonmail sounds pretty good, I just see to downsides with it:- I probably can't use the iOS email client (which makes sense of course as they don't have my private key)- They don't encrypt header information	
5293	 jakethepeg111	 This works fine, but you have to [install one before the other](https://forums.bitfire.at/topic/1478/doesn-t-regocnize-open-tasks/3). Uninstall davdroid. Install opentasks. Install davdroid.

5295	 DoktorTeufel	 Well, for one thing, he obediently got right back in line and supported pro-corporate Hillary Clinton once he lost the rigged Democratic primary. It seems that toeing the party line is more important than ideals after all.For another, he acquired a $600,000 summer getaway (it really is beautiful; Google it up sometime) not long after his campaign went up in smoke. That campaign was in no small part funded by the generous donations of people living paycheck to paycheck, and those donations also went up in smoke... now, technically he did nothing wrong, but Joe Blow doesn't understand that. It just looks bad.In any case, it's amusing to see someone accusing others of being stupid and ignorant while at the same time employing juvenile nicknames like "Turnip" to vent his impotent rage. The indignant screeching of Redditors didn't prevent Trump from being elected the first time, no matter how furiously they upvoted and agreed with each other, and next election he'll be an incumbent—so perhaps the anti-Trump brigade should turn off CNN or close the BuzzFeed News tab for five minutes and reconsider its tactics?I'm only kidding. I'm actually looking forward to nearly seven more years of screeching, tantrum-throwing Redditors.	
5296	 nonbelligerentmoron	 Youre wrong. First of all american christians for the most part are way more charitable and christlike and kind and generous people than most liberals. Second of all, theyre still selfish pricks. Cuz the one thing every human on earth has in common is theyre a selfish prick. But you clearly dont know many actual christians in the us lol.

5298	 PrivacyRabbit	 I do believe you are able to view file history while using boxcryptor, although I may be wrong. I'd certainly recommend you use boxcryptor for all your files for complete privacy, but its up to you :)	
5299	 thijser2	 I would counter that today a gun is not an effective weapon against a government. For that you really need explosives. Explosives can take down combat vehicles, troops, and infrastructure. So if we follow this line of thinking then it should be explosives we should be advocating for not guns.In fact if we look at people who actually fight the government then we find that they are mostly terrorists and that almost all anti terror laws are very effective in stopping anyone willing to fight against the government. Logically the position "we need guns to be able to stop/overthrow the government" is not really consistent with support for just about any anti terror law. 	
5300	 PrivacyRabbit	 I can't comment on your first question, but when it comes to email I'd recommend [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com), a private and secure email service based in Switzerland

5325	 iamnewtothisstuff	 You point to the American Civil War as a positive(?) example. I would think that it's a prime example against free guns for everybody. Why enable a pro-violence antidemocratic (in the sense that they didn't using politics) group to cause a giant war.But why are "pro gun" people so fixated on guns? You think a gun saves you from a dooming opression of a pending shift of power in the US? Even if a "evil force" went against "the will of the people" would you not think they would use tanks, aircrafts, ships, drones, A-Bombs?... Then shoot them with your revolver. Wars have changed. Information and misinformation are the weapons of the now. Populism and Intrigue are the way to "win". You fight this war with other weapons like (free) education (esp political education and propaganda free history), free media, free speech, free internet, free information. The populace is swayed by (irrational) fears of immanent terrorist attacks. "my religious freedom", "my jobs", "those immigrants"... And all from a twitterpost of a hijab wearing mcdonalds server which cost the state not even 50cents.

However, many of them are symmetric encryption algorithms which are not as widely used as asymmetric algorithms (such as RSA) because they have known problems even before considering hackers, i.e the encryption and decryption key are the same and must somehow be transmitted from user to user so they can communicate the information	
5332	 c-pid	 &gt;This post was written with regard to the fictional target being from the United States, but it could very easily be adapted to work with persons from another country.No, it wont be easily adapted to work with other countries. As far as I seen it the author worked with the fact that in the US (any maybe some other countries too), the prefix of a mobile phone number is area dependent. While this is true for the US, for example in Germany, it is not. This decreases the information gain by a lot, increasing the possible phone numbers making a bruteforce attack by hand useless.	
5333	 logical_up	 Calm down pal, not everyone has a maths or physics degree, or the time to go through heavy duty peer-reviewed papers. Popular science does a very good job in getting complicated information out there. If you are a scientist (I know I am), you owe your job to this kind of work, it makes taxpayers or whoever funds you understand why your job is important. It is not shit. In all fairness, quantum computers can bring humanity to a higher level in a sense, as they will allow scientists to model physical phenomena to a much improved standard. Remember, these things were though up in the 80s, one of the first (not the first, one of them) was Richard Feynman, with regard to simulating complicated physical systems from first principles (see https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF02650179 for a very interesting take on this).On the other hand, can you suggest some interesting links to read up on computational complexity or some quantum computing use cases? I am always happy to learn more.

5358	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
5359	 iamnewtothisstuff	 The error they made is to think that the propaganda will never work to this extent. But even after 10 years the nazis still had to deport them to descrete locations and kill them off silently with a small radicalised force. From what is the gun going to protect me from? The theif with a gun? Why do you think he has a gun?From the police? Think of a island where noone has a gun. Neither you, nor a theif. Why would the police need one? 	
5360	 ae-keji	 Yes and they prompted anti gun regulation for it. Which I find amusing. 	
5361	 ShutUpWesl3y	 The gun is going to protect me from someone breaking into my condo in the middle of the night. It’s a real threat where I live in Chicago. Gang violence and gang crime in general is no joke. Where do you live?	
5362	 thijser2	 Which is why rebels in Syria use improvised explosives, chemical mortals and bomb carrying drones. You are never going to take down a tank with just a handgun, but a bit of c4 on a bridge will. You won't stop a group of soldiers with a few untrained individuals with handguns but a few chemical mortals might.  The question is is if you are ok with civilians having explosive or chemical weapons but if you want to be able to overthrow a government that will be required.

5368	 ClutchHunter	 Elaborate?	
5369	 ClutchHunter	 I agree. Guns aren't very useful as a tool of resistance; it's just a fantasy that a lot of Americans in particular have.	
5370	 iamnewtothisstuff	 I don't say that they should take your means of protection away. But reduce the uncontrolled easy avaiable guns for thugs. And that must happen with regulation. It is a bit utopic. It won't be easy in the US. But some sanitychecks would really help. And some states have them already. But slow an steady wins the race. You have so many weapons in circulation that, even if a total ban would start tomorrow, some could still use the hidden 10% for 50 years and on. Same with WW2 weapons in my country. Some still have an old gun in their attic. But you don't need it. Which is good.	
5371	 ShutUpWesl3y	 How do you stop illegal things from happening? Like gang members getting guns? It’s impossible 	
5372	 iamnewtothisstuff	 If you have a gun you feel mighty. If you feel mighty you are secure. The need to feel secure is extremly basic to every living thing and can therefor easily be manipulated by a political motivated power. 	
5373	 iamnewtothisstuff	 The problem is that it is not illegal for gang members to get guns. From this springs the gun violence. General violence and illegal activity mostly stems from socioeconomic reasons and will not be solved by this. 	
5374	 Alpha_Bit_Poop	 &gt; Women (voting)Haha, women voting actually did have a militant arm that would assassinate people.  I think one of them took a shot at one of the presidents.  I am sorry I can't back that up with a wikipedia link but there were violent suffragets.	
5375	 Alpha_Bit_Poop	 &gt; Guns are a check on power because they make the cost of subjugating a population by force significantly higher. I kinda believe that too, but then I saw a video of my cop / swat team friend who was at a shooting competition.  And his skill level was so vastly and staggaringly higher than anything a normal person could do it really made me think of the absurdity of your argument.  Especially when weighed against the horrible problem of gun violence our country has.So basically no normal american could ever compete with someone who uses guns as part of their day job.

5381	 Alpha_Bit_Poop	 Soooo, now we are getting into the realm of theory.  Lots of people would say you need an armed wing of whatever movement you are part of to put real pressure on power, and that you also need a peaceful wing to be an acceptable substitute for power to side with.  The country of India getting independence is a good example of this, Ghandi was the peaceful side, but there was also very real attacks against the British government happening at the same time.One of the reasons given for the environmental movement making such slow progress is because there is no violent wing of the green movement in the USA.	
5382	 fucking_weebs	 Great argument friendo	
5383	 dschuma	 The short answer is the way the law has been written and interpreted has prevented court review. To litigate you need standing, a legal doctrine that shows how you in particular have been hurt. Since the spying is secret, litigants cannot prove they personally have been spied on. If you can’t prove that you cannot move on to the merits (is it constitutional)In addition, prosecutors have failed to notify defendants when the government has spied on them and uses a process called parallel construction to further disguise it. So it hasn’t been possible to challenge this in court on the merits. This bill would also cut out many of the grounds for challenging the unconstitutionality. I’m summarizing and skipping important details, but this is a good overview.

5389	 iamnewtothisstuff	 Good points. But the peaceful wing-forcefull wing model doesn't specify the necessary force to press the cause.Lets take the suffragettes once more. One side protests for voting and human rights. The forcefull side could have been that every woman just didn't work for a week. (work including at home or with children).The Force of workstrikes is great. No need for guns. Ghandi was his own force with his hungerstrike. Because the "real attacks" didn't enough.The problem with the environmental movement (worldwide) is that the enemy are not humans. The enemy are huge concerns with big profits to lose. And the humans therein have the "i am only a cog" mentality.	
5390	 ClutchHunter	 If you're in the US, I'd guess it's because:1. Your police all seem to carry guns as far as I can tell. And generally the culture surrounding them is a lot worse.2. You're surrounded by land in which there is no such gun control, so it's easy to smuggle them in.The UK suffers from neither of these issues.	
5391	 ae-keji	 1) Monarchy (idgaf if it's constitutional or not, or their actual power or not. Any monarchy is too much monarchy. All men are created equal, death to kings, and so on)2) Separation of church and state3) House of lords4) Constitutional rights to privacy and freedom of speech Regardless of how our governments may act in practice, yours has no checks and balances or safeguards to its power. Yours is what I would consider a feudal relic incompatible with democracy and post enlightenment ideals. While I would consider the United States a dysfunctional republic, the United Kingdom is operating just how intended. 	
5392	 ae-keji	 I genuinely believe American citizens should have access to fully automatic machine guns, and in practice we already have access to explosives. That being said, fuck you for advocating chemical weapons. Those didn't bring either side any closer to winning and ended up killing an awful lot of non combatants. 	
5393	 ClutchHunter	 1) I'm a British Republican i.e. I'm against the monarchy. I agree.2) That's tied to #1.3) Although I'm against them principally and would vote to have them removed, they do provide some much needed scrutiny to the crap that the HoC attempts to pass.4) Agreed.You're incorrect about checks and balances. Our PM has less power than your president (AFAIK), and though they are undemocratic, our HoL acts as a safeguard against the HoC.I think we're culturally a lot closer to reform than you are, also.  Prior to Brexit - which sadly looks set to potentially occupy our collective political minds for at least the next decade - there was talk of HoL reform. There's also been a lot of talk about electoral reform as well (changing away from FPTP).The US on the other hand has just had a guy elected who lost the popular vote. And how far away is electoral reform there?I also doubt that a populace armed with guns will ever help you against a tyrannical government as powerful as either as ours, but that's a whole other debate.

5400	 LadyOzymandias	 Grrr, PMs/DMs are what get me the most. I've sent a handful of those through Reddit and several years ago conducted a lot of intimate correspondence on a private forum with those when I didn't know better. The admins had a thing that they didn't/couldn't read PMs, and even explained there was nothing to worry about there. fml. 	
5401	 thijser2	 Personally I'm against both explosives, chemical weapons and guns. A civil war is going to result in a ton of civilian deaths no matter what and I think cutting funding to police and military is a better way of leveling the playing field if you wish to go that way. Or do you really think a revolution with guns and explosives in city centers wasn't going to cause thousand of death civilians? 	
5402	 Kee-Me	 Thanks for explaining the /ru/r21vo.I don't plan on getting a VPN anytime soon, is it possible to keep traffic private/encrypted with out VPN.

5408	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 Just don't register in **ANY** website with your real name, that should keep you off search engine indexing. If you want serious protection from advertising agencies, get a VPN, block Java scripts. Use different Proton Mail accounts for different parts of your online life. For e.g. for gaming, use one Proton Mail account across Steam, Humble Bundle, etc. Don't use that email in any other part of your life. Create another email id for your work life. Create another email for online shopping sites. Use user agent switchers on random modes for confusing the fuck out of trackers. This way you can **in theory** be different people in different places around the world. Hope this helped.

5413	 PrivacyRabbit	 If possible, try self-hosting, you can use [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/) and direct it to upload to your host. It ensures privacy (as long as you use a host that you trust), while still being a easy to use solution, it simply requires a bit of set-up. I have personally been using ShareX for about a year and have no complaints. EDIT: You can use ShareX for gifs, images, videos, etc. 	
5414	 ae-keji	 Well going by that line of thinking we may as well try a nuclear war anytime we get into a conflict, because there will be civilian deaths anyways. And just because I'm in favor of a populace that can defend itself doesn't mean I'm opposed to limiting the violent capacity of any organization that can exert its authority unjustly.

5417	 thijser2	 If you are going to fight the US army then you are going up against trained soldiers, combat vehicles, has air superiority, controls many communication channels and has highly skilled generals. If you are going to fight against that and win a military victory then you are going to have to fight fairly dirty. Chemical and explosive weapons(especially booby traps) can bypass many of the defenses that such a superior enemy can deploy. I think ideally such a war wouldn't take place in the first place and that this can be achieved by making every soldier capable of question in their orders and ensuring they have a basic understanding in ethics, law and aren't just following orders. In such a situation the army is far less likely to try to suppress the population as doing so risks the soldiers turning against the generals.

5453	 GearBent	 You severely misunderstand how the internet works.You pay the ISP for a certain amount of bandwidth, say 30 mbps.That means they have a obligation to provide you with 30 mbps of bandwidth.Data is data, so it doesn't matter where that 30mbps of data is coming from, whether that be Netflix, Reddit, or Steam.  You pay for the right to access the internet at the bandwidth you pay for.Now, ISP's don't actually reserve 30 mbps just for you (unless you're on a business line), they'll oversell the amount of bandwidth they can provide to your neighborhood, based on the assumption that not everyone will be using 100% of their bandwidth all the time. (This is why speeds are advertised as "Up to x mbps").  This is a pretty reasonable assumption, but ISPs have oversold the amount of bandwidth they can provide so much that they can't keep up with the growing amount of data that websites and video streaming services dish out.The solution to this is quite simple: Just run out more lines to their customers and/or upgrade their existing infrastructure.ISPs decided instead that they'd rather just change the law so they don't actually need to spend a single dime of their profits on upgrading their infrastructure.

5457	 Arbor4	 I use NoScript in a privacy confirgured Firefox don't regret enabling it. A surprising amount of websites work without JS, and if you do encounter one - just whitelist the local JS files and its CDN. Google/Facebook trackers should always be blacklisted.

5465	 GearBent	 Conversely, I pay Cox for 40mbps.Over the last year they have added a data cap, and the speeds have dwindled to 20 mbps.	
5466	 makeworld	 Yeah that's my biggest privacy thing, splitting services. Companies having data on us is bad, but it's a much smaller problem if it's like it was in the earlier years of the internet, with smaller companies only knowing small sections about us. 	
5467	 JosephRT	 Outta curiosity, can you give a rough idea as to what you've seen?  I've had Comcast for 7 years and I have yet to see a free speed increase.  There are now faster speeds available, such as Gb, but I've never gotten a free upgrade.

5477	 JosephRT	 Do phone companies really charge nowadays for long distance and peak hours?  My folks live in the sticks, and they haven't had to pay long distance charges in years.  I suppose there some companies out there that still do, but I don't know of them.  Granted I've got a pretty small sample size, can you link me to a util that still charges?And I'm not sure that I could say that USPS is a utility.  USPS, while a public service, as far as I'm aware doesn't maintain any infrastructure, does it?  I'm also not sure if there is an "official" definition, but I've considered it to be organizations that maintain infrastructure (water, power, public landfill, etc).  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_utility) seems to sort of agree.To me, ISPs are more of a utility.  If I want high speeds, I have to go with Comcast in my area; there's no one else that provides high speed internet in my area.  I suppose I could possibly go with dial-up or maybe DSL, but I'd about argue that that's not really competition.  Instead I have one choice, they have all of the infrastructure (kind of doubt anyone else is going to come in and lay down fiber everywhere, and doubt that Comcast wouldn't fight it).  If I don't really have a choice in the matter and they own all of the public infrastructure, why wouldn't they be considered a utility?	
5478	 RibMusic	 The brave honesty of the modern GOP and conservative media sets a shining example for how we should all behave.	
5479	 RedwallAllratuRatbar	 Indeed. Let's say we have two users, one torrents two 10gb games per month, another watches everything on netflix. First guy is paying too much for his internet, second too little. So second guy is a leech. And because netflix provides for 50% of whole internet trafic in the usa. Yes, let's make them pay so prices can fall for normal users.

5482	 oldmanchewy	 Oh hey look r/The_Donald is here.	
5483	 trai_dep	 While Trump still can veto, and the House passed it, that it's this close in the Senate is still amazing. Less amazing (in a bad way) than almost the entire GOP conspiring to destroy Net Neutrality, but:1) What an incredibly crappy look for the GOP, and,2) Judicial review could add the fact that the Senate voted against this destructive attempt in their deliberations to allow this FCC to continue this travesty.	
5484	 notcaffeinefree	 Though *technically* Congress could override the veto if they had the votes, but that will never happen.	
5485	 bolivar-shagnasty	 What did the house pass?	
5486	 steak_and_eagles	 Ignoring your straw man (comparison of NN to overnight shipping through USPS), at the very least the last sentence really undermines you. You called people who support NN idiots, and failed to recognize any reason to do so other than to "keep their internet bills low".Yes cost is certainly a factor but NN is about more than that. To me the much bigger point is that without NN, ISPs have the ability to: paywall information, push specific internet services in favor of others by setting separate prices for competing services, and effectively create an environment where the (relatively) even playing field of the internet as a service marketplace no longer exists.Your neighbor might not be able to start that website, eshop, app, etc. (Streaming service, for example) because they won't be able to afford the priority bandwidth that the big established players (like a Netflix, hulu....) can. Why swap from one service to another if one is as slow as dial-up? NN is about much more than individual consumers saving/losing $10/month	
5487	 emiliogt	 A lot of companies put software that does that (and more) in the computers they give to their employers.And last time I checked, it wasn't illegal. 	
5488	 bdoguru	 You can keep your doctor. Premiums will go down!	
5489	 bdoguru	 I agree. The real problem is infrastructure monopolies. Problem is, with all the regulation, we disincentivize businesses to build the infrastructure of the future. Makes us stuck with what we have.

5501	 RoboticTetra	 &gt; You can do that? Yes	
5502	 trai_dep	 The House didn't. It lost on a party line vote. But to override a Trump veto, the House would need to pass that veto.The EFF has one of their great Deep Links articles on [what to do after the FCC’s Republicans voted to kill Net Neutrality](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/12/team-internet-far-done-whats-next-net-neutrality-and-how-you-can-help)	
5503	 GearBent	 That's... not even close to correct.With the internet, the total amount of data moved across your connection costs nothing, the connection is either being used or it's sitting there doing nothing. Moving a 10gb file costs no more than a 1tb file.What is at a premium is bandwidth, since only so much data can be moved across the network in any given period of time.That's why you pay for the speed (ie 10mbps, 50mpbs, gigabit), not the amount of data you use.In your metaphor, the guy streaming netflix might be paying for a gigabit internet connection, while the guy who torrents might only be paying for 30 mpbs. They're paying for what they want/need.	
5504	 bolivar-shagnasty	 &gt; While Trump still can veto, and the House passed itThat's why I asked. It isn't clear what you mean by this statement. 	
5505	 LatticeCrypted	 So what you're saying is that politicians of both parties don't really care about the people? I'm *shocked*.	
5506	 trai_dep	 Technically, the House did NOT pass the CRA, but the Senate is within striking distance of it. If the CRA passed, it would reverse the FCC ruling. Just getting this close is good, but obviously not as good as if the GOP represented the millions of American consumers over a handful of entrenched oligopolies.PS: Have you called your Senator yet? That seems much more constructive than parsing sentences on a Reddit post. ;)

5545	 benyar	 To be absolutely fair, it happens.  When Google announced Fiber in my area, Comcast responded with a 50% increase in speed for free, so we could hit our data caps faster.

5549	 trai_dep	 Senator Schumer [begs to differ](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-vote/senate-democrats-to-force-vote-on-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-idUSKBN1E92TC):&gt;“There will be a vote to repeal the rule that the FCC passed. It’s in our power to do that,” Schumer said in New York. “Sometimes we don’t like them, when they used it to repeal some of the pro environmental regulations, **but now we can use the CRA to our benefit and we intend to.**”Have you called your Senators yet, instead of engaging in Internet pedantry? You should consider it!

5552	 lfod14	 &gt; Just getting this close is good, but obviously not as good as if the GOP represented the millions of American consumers over a handful of entrenched oligopolies.Exactly, because if theres one way to help consumers its for strict government regulation to force them to take it up the ass from the Netflix's and Hulu's and then pass the loss to the residential customer. Unreal. 	
5553	 bolivar-shagnasty	 &gt; Technically, the House did NOT pass the CRA, but the Senate is within striking distance of it. If the CRA passed, it would reverse the FCC ruling. Just getting this close is good, but obviously not as good as if the GOP represented the millions of American consumers over a handful of entrenched oligopolies.You said the House didn't pass the Congressional Review Act. The act has been law for over 20 years. It was signed into law by President Clinton and was used only once before Trump's presidency in 2001It doesn't seem that you know much or anything about the CRA, when it was passed, how it must be used, and what happens with the votes. You're also cherry-picking your quotes. From the same article: &gt;A reversal of Thursday’s FCC vote would need the approval of the Senate, U.S. House and President Donald Trump. Trump also backed the FCC action, the White House said Thursday.For the record, I have contacted Senators Shelby and Jones, Congresswoman Martha Roby of AL-02, three of her primary challengers, and her only Democrat challenger. 	
5554	 trai_dep	 Again, pedantry. You're interpreting my use of "CRA" to mean the establishment of the act itself, not use of the act to counter the specific actions of an Executive regulative body, its purpose. Yours is a really weird interpretation that makes no sense given the context. Unless we're talking about Senator Hermione Granger (note to self: this would be *awesome!*)For the record, hopefully you urged your representatives to vote Team Dumbledore, not Team Voldemort! :)	
5555	 trai_dep	 We found That One Guy who ❤️s Comcast. And trusts Verizon. *Wow!*	
5556	 lfod14	 I despise both of them equally, but I'm not stupid enough to not see that in EVERY case of a company being federally forced to take it in the rear, that it doesn't come out on the customer end. I'm also not ignorant enough to think that "Net Neutrality" is what the media thinks it is, or delusional enough to think it was something we actually had by it's own definition. Do YOU remember the horrible internet BEFORE "net neutrality"? Think WAY back, all TWO years ago!	
5557	 FapMaster64	 Democrats have control of the headlines, not Trump. Not even close.	
5558	 notcaffeinefree	 And not just you. If you appear in *any* photo that's been uploaded to Google or Facebook, this is pointless.It's the same thing with Facebook (or Google) and your phone number. Chances are that even if you have never given them your phone number, they already have it from someone else.	
5559	 selfsufficientnigga	 #BERNIE CAN STILL WIN!	
5560	 bolivar-shagnasty	 The CRA has a very specific definition and connotation. The House and Senate wouldn't "pass a CRA related to NN". They would have to pass a House Resolution, Senate Resolution, and a Joint Resolution. That's how the Congressional Review Act empowers the congress to undo a regulation. You can't use "CRA" and "Joint Resolution" interchangeably. You still seem to have a nebulous understanding of how the whole process works. There's already too many Front Page posts that claim that Democrats are just one vote away from restoring Net Neutrality. Your inaccurate comments only serve to muddy the waters further.

5568	 TinyTimmyIsTiny	 Not a very avid speaker but ehNet Neutrality invokes Title II of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to require all ISPs and any company that provides internet service to register for Broadcasting Liscenses from the government and regularly renew them. Combine this with the Countering Information Warfare Act of 2016 and Net Neutrality definitely isn't something you want.Lets say, hypothetically, the government were to label reddit as a site of propaganda, you would be forced to blacklist it. Failure to comply? They revoke your liscense thus making what you're hosting illegalit just sounds nice	
5569	 FeatheryAsshole	 "if you have to ask ... "	
5570	 brennanfee	 &gt; I think that there's a cynical, popular acceptance of there being a false equivalency between the republicans and democrats.Yes, and I don't disagree with that on a lot of topics.  I agree that a lot of the time the "scale" of the issue can be very different between the groups.  Furthermore, It can be so drastically different as to make the standard arguments of equivalency laughable.  But I truly believe that is not what I am doing on this particular topic.For instance, we all know that politicians lie - they spin, they hedge, in short they all lie.  Some estimates put it at around 30% of the time politicians lie.  That is higher than the average person but not "terrible" per se.  However, we can all objectively say that Trump lies MORE often and so using arguments in his defense like "all politicians lie" is spurious because we are talking about a different scale altogether.However, on the topic of serving their donors - and not the people - both sides are EQUALLY at fault.  That's my point.  What the people want, what the average citizen would prefer, does not reflect itself in public policy and hasn't for quite some time.  This is my point.Are "some" of the things Dems stand for better... of course (including Citizens United).  But that doesn't mean that they are necessarily doing things that are what the people want - and to any extent they are it is because it is what their donors want.  This is the very heart and definition of what it means to be in an oligarchy.  The will of the people doesn't matter.  We are relegated to subjects not citizens.&gt; You say dems want power just as much as the right...In that context I was referring to the "tools" of power (and particularly in this case the power to spy on US citizens without a warrant).  And... yes, both sides want it and both sides have continued the policy (which began under George W, was continued and expanded during 8 years of Obama, and was just extended further for Trump - a man who would clearly use such power for his own purposes; the very poster boy of why the government should not have such power).  It isn't power per se but a tool of the powerful.&gt; If you make the argument that efforts to enact environmental protections, or consumer protections, or affordable health care are somehow just attempts to seize power then you have a warped perspective.I am not making that claim.&gt; When you say that when dems are in power, the people don't get what they wantI am making that claim with only the caveat (as I mentioned above) that sometimes the donors of the dems are slightly better and do want things that are in the people's best interests.  However, you have to understand that this is not WHY the donors want those things... they are still personally benefiting from those policies; any benefit to the people is just a bonus in their eyes.  The donors of the dems don't want single payer any more than the donors of the GOP.  That's why we didn't get the public option and why single payer is DOA in Congress.  That's why it was a major part of Bernie's campaign (who didn't have major donors but instead had lots of real people supporting him with small donations).  No other candidate would have touched that subject lest they suffer the wrath of their donors.What we need to do in order to be able to separate the two is use issue polling to indicate where the people are and then look at the policies we receive.Another great example is on gun control.  We get no movement on that issue because the donors of the Dems also want the guns out there (although not as much as the donors on the right).  That's why we see no substantive change on that issue.  The polling on this is painfully clear and has been done multiple times over the last decade.  Over 90% of all people polled want some sensible changes.  For instance, over 90% are for closing the so-called gun show loophole.  If you limit that polling just to Republican's it is still over 80%.  Hell, a few of the polls even showed that over 70% of NRA members want that loophole changed.  But the NRA doesn't work for its members any more than the political parties work for their constituents any more.  [In case you are wondering, the NRA works for the gun manufacturers.]  With polling numbers like that you would think any politician would jump at the chance to pass legislation that would please so many people... but they don't care about the people; they have to keep their donors happy and the money rolling in.You see the same thing in issue after issue.  If you look at the issues overall, what you find is that it is in "big business" or "corporate policy" that the two sides have tons of overlap.  That makes sense given that their donors (for both sides) are people who run big giant companies and are merely jockeying for financial benefit and position.  To whatever extent their "positions" benefit the people is entirely incidental.  Multi-national corporations have eaten our governments for lunch.

Since then, I've had some time to read up more on the numbering scheme for cell phone numbers (in specific) in Germany, and I've found that they are assigned based on carrier/network, and thus can still be enumerated (by hand if need be, too). I have also taken into account mobile number portability, and found that it has no affect on the method described in the blog post.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_numbers_in_Germany

5600	 uoxuho	 I'm not sure exactly what that is, so I'll speak somewhat generally.You can protect against almost all fingerprinting stuff simply by running NoScript. NoScript blocks all of that crap from ever running in the first place.Assuming your computer itself is secure, then you are most likely protected by a given man-in-the-middle attack against HTTPS. In order for someone to MITM your HTTPS connection, they need to either:* Serve you an invalid certificate, or* Gain access to your computer some other way in order to proactively "trust" their fake certificate on your computer.Hope that helps; feel free to ask more!	
5601	 nysnyd	 Thanks for your comments. I am looking to see how I can make it work without JS. Thanks for pointing out the issue.	
5602	 FinnishCobweb	 Believe it or not, you are actually off to a good start here with your attitude. There are different ways you can approach this to achieve better privacy and security in your current situation. Regardless of which direction you take, compartmentalization will be the foundation. I'm going to assume that you are already using U2F to protect your gmail account? Usually Youtubers have a powerful system for content creation. You can choose to separate  your work and personal life via virtual machines or another physical computer. Of course you would use different personas for your personal life accounts (email,social media, etc). This is just a start, there are another things needed depending on how far you are willing to go with this.

5609	 FinnishCobweb	 Do not be fooled. Microsoft is not in the business of fighting for your privacy.

5617	 Executor89	 Are you joking? What did DNS and web hosts do to conservative news site Rebel Media under net neutrality? They shut it down. Why? Free speech is unpopular and Western governments supported by leftists such as yourself favor attacking/killing free speech. If you think censorship by businesses is bad then you will hate censorship by government which will be more dangerous and absolute.You dishonestly hide the fact that under the free market there is opportunity for people to create ISPs, choose ISPs, and boycott bad ISPs. Why does the US have shit ISP's? Because of local governments creating artificial local monopolies that limit new entrants. The first step is this, not expanding the scope of government that will be used by monopolists to undermine your efforts.Anyone who is reading this, note that I_Am_The_Pen has no idea what he is talking about. He supports censorship namely censorship by government. He is uninformed and not looking at the extreme negative consequences that will result from giving government power.To kill Net Neutrality is a step forward in promoting the marketplace of free ideas, the internet.	
5618	 FinnishCobweb	 The goal of security is to reduce risks. You can never eliminate all of it.

Keep your devices softwares up to date with patches, you a password manager, use two factor auth.government metadata collection: There will always be metadata, it's just a matter of putting the pieces together.

5627	 acolytic	 What if the service took care of ensuring sites don't track? So the only way for site owners to use the service and get the money is to not use advertising/tracking and this was something that would be audited. If the site is found to track users anyway, they will be kicked out of the program. Since there is a financial motivation for the service to verify this, it becomes more likely they will try to fight this.	
5628	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
5629	 acolytic	 Is the idea that they would take the money and track you anyway? I answered this in another comment but you could just audit it right? And since the service has a financial interest in verifying that site owners are not tracking anyway, it should theoretically be harder to get around that.

When the two have nothing to do with each other. How clever of you to copy and paste what I said and add my username in it. That just shows you're being paid to spread your shit. Or you're an ignorant fool.To kill Net Neutrality is to create mass censorship over the United States and soon after the world.

5645	 c-pid	 I assume you are the author of the text?I just checked it with my mobile phone number (I am German). While yes, the dial number in front of it, is carrier assigned usually, it does not mean that the owner has to be at said carrier at the moment. In Germany it is possible to switch your carrier and keeping your phone number.I tried your method. I don't own a Facebook account, so I can only try so much. I use the following services that know my mobile phone number:- GitHub- PayPal- SteamFirst I tried GitHub to learn about my phone number. I couldn't find any information about it. Not even the last two digits.Then I went to PayPal and indeed it showed me a lot of information. It presented me my phone number in the format of (01*** ***0617). This would give an attacker following information: The dialing code has 5 numbers, and my phone number ends with 0617. One thing I am unsure about is, if PayPal always shows the dialing code as 5 numbers, even when it is an actual phone number with a dialing code of 4 numbers.Anyway, an attacker can look up the dialing codes and we have 16 possible dialing codes for a German phone number. (https://www.billiger-telefonieren.de/thema/handy-vorwahlen/)Assuming that all numbers from 000 to 999 are available, we have in total 16*1000 possible phone numbers. So 16.000 numbers to check.Assuming Facebook has an API allowing to search for phone numbers with a script it may be possible. But in my case I don't have a Facebook account, if I had one, I wouldn't allow to be find via mobile numbers (when that's configurable).But I also checked out Steam. Steam only told me my last two digits. So I didn't learn anything new there. But I found out that an attacker could use Steam to verify if a mobile phone number is connected to a certain email. Exactly what you did with Facebook.To do that I went to Steam -&gt; Log In -&gt; Lost Password -&gt; Enter the mobile phone number to verify -&gt; "I no longer have access to my Steam Guard Mobile Authenticator" -&gt; "I no longer have access to this phone number". It will show the targets email in the form n***.***@g****.c**. Since we know the targets email, we can say with high certainty that phone number and mail belong to the same person.BUT steam provides NO API for this. Means we would need to check in worst case 16.000 numbers. And this is in no case feasible by hand in a reasonable time.While I do think that your method is applicable and feasible for a US mobile number, I highly doubt it to be feasible for a German mobile phone number.

5647	 MavSC	 I just want to stop companies making money off of my online activity and keep my stuff safe from malicious hacking. I don't have the need or skills to be running tails and looking at source code but I have a lot of respect for those that do. I benefit from the 'trickle down' knowledge that comes from those folks. Do I need to build an F1 engine to maintain my VW engine effectively? I think the same about privacy and security. 	
5648	 __GLOBAL_LOCAL__	 FISA section 702 authority for electronic surveillance isn't unconstitutional in legal theory, unless you account for the FBI/DEA parallel construction (fabricated informants) that arise in investigations utilizing brokered NSA intelligence which may make it unclear.The jurisdiction of the constitution of the United States of America applies only domestically, when your digital signal leaves the USA whether under the sea or across the sky you're circuit is susceptible to foreign surveillance.This is how it's likely theorized legally, from a federal FISA court perspective. To save time and be practical, the NSA simply collects the signals before reaching their foreign destination.Technically it's not a violation of the fourth amendment, since (I suppose) 702 assumes that any signal propagating at or near the speed of light near the edge of domestic communications are practically foreign intelligence except by a latency of more or less than (what?) 1 nanosecond.This is why you see passive dragnet wiretapping of AT&amp;T communications which ultimately reach under-sea cables at San Francisco and New York City international telecom hub centers.

5650	 __GLOBAL_LOCAL__	 Exactly the object (ie. a knife) itself isn't illegal but it's role and commission in a crime make it evidence. The object of evidence in this case then becomes illegal to possess or destroy except by investigating law enforcement after probable cause or the act of crime is established.

5659	 vteead	 The app sounds interesting nysnyd.Why not talk about that.  Seems like your hiding something.  What are you hiding nysnyd? If someone uses the arguement that "they have nothing to hide" they likely would not be concerned about a border crossing guard examining their phone, unless they texted they were bringing back an undersized lobster, or something similar.  If they are engaging in a double life and hand over their phone to their spouse or significant other and give them the conseel pass code, well that is furthering a deception.  And they know they have something they are trying to hide.  Maybe that is what you should be aiming for.  Conseel if you are trying to hide something.Maybe what you really want is a counter argument to deception is stupid.  Like deception can get you more time with those you cheat with and more time with those you deceive.Look nysnyd  I am not against you.  Your methods to market your product are deceptive though.  The meta to this is find the argument that best supports your activities.Ashley Madison took ownership of what they were selling.

5671	 FeatheryAsshole	 yes, that's the idea.if things like audits were implemented, sure - i just have doubt that it will happen.-  there'd need to be some kind of certification that a site does indeed not track, which is hard to implement before the payment mechanism is strong enough .- chicken and egg: a site has to give up tracking first to start gaining money through this, but as long as only a few users take part in this project, they will most likely gain less than before.     - as an alternative, there could be a legal requirement that all sites have to cease tracking - but then how does just this service get around it? also, it would not apply internationally, so you'd have to keep your tracking protection up, anyway.

5674	 Tyil	 Saying "YEAY Microsoft" because they don't ask for your personally identifying information up front sounds like a very short-sighted way of going about this. Don't forget the latest version of their OS is basically a spyware package that happens to be able to run other software as well. I'd advise to stay as far away from anything Microsoft related as you can if you care about your privacy.Have they done anything to actually **promote** privacy in any way or form? Have they gone out of their way to protect your data? Do they allow you to customize their software such that it will not send **any** data to unwanted parties? Do they even allow you to inspect the software and see what it's doing in the first place?	
5675	 Darkeyescry22	 We've always had net neutrality. It's a principle, not a law. The FCC has always fought against data discrimination.Since you're so sure that net neutrality is different than what everyone else thinks it is, why don't you share what you think it is?	
5676	 Darkeyescry22	 The Republican politicians made it a partisan issue when they openly supported is removal.If you want to think about it more finely, just vote for candidates who support bet neutrality. You'll end up with the same thing, but then you'll understand why.	
5677	 Darkeyescry22	 It actually is Republicans vs Democrats here, and that is 100% because of the Republican politicians, who supported the FCC in removing NN.That said, the headline is still false, because the senate alone can't do that. They also need the house (majority Republican) and the white house (also Republican).	
5678	 fz1jmp	 Don't use any vendor provided cloud storage or monitoring feature. My cameras are 100% self contained on my LAN and I can VPN into my home if I need to look at them.

For example, contact enforcement, false advertising restrictions, etc.

5697	 tabireux	 Hi @c-pid,The sites I mentioned in the text are only a handful out of other sites out there, mostly because the ones that I mentioned provide a greater success rate when it comes to this method. I say this with consideration and due to to the number of digits exposed, the amount of people likely to be registered and simultaneously have their phone number attached to their accounts, amongst other varying factors. Of course there are likely many other websites which could be substituted for the ones mentioned in the piece due to differing factors such as geographic location; for example, say, a Germany-based food ordering website, which also reveals partial phone number digits on its password reset page.There is a list of prerequisites (so to speak) which needs to be met for the method to work as smoothly as possible. I would like to add that eliminating or rather substituting Facebook for the purpose of finding the last two digits from the list is insignificant towards retrieving the full phone number—since Google, or even Steam like you mentioned, reveal the last two digits as well.I am aware that PayPal supplies the first two digits instead of just one, when the trunk prefix is attached (‘0’ digit) to the phone number, which I believe might be the case for your account, but since the first digit would be the trunk prefix, it would become utterly useless. I would suggest that you try using Yahoo's password reset page, as I'm fairly certain that they ignore trunk prefixes and also reveal the first two digits of the phone number while doing so. After doing this, the number of attempts would already be shortened down to 5 * 10,000 = 15,000.Additionally, scouting the social media profiles of the target would be useful for gathering information regarding their carrier (such as instances where they have publicly posted about their carrier, or smartphone screenshots which visibly display their phone carrier), which, if porting wasn’t a factor, would subsequently also reveal their phone code, but since it is a factor, we will just have to go with the assumption that the target has more than likely not ported their number to another carrier—since newly issued numbers are always done so within the respective carrier’s assigned phone code.However, if that leads to no results, the 15,000 (or lesser) tries would have to be automated with a script on sites such as Facebook, Steam, etc.Furthermore, I'd like to clarify that this is not a one-size-fits-all guide, but rather a detailed explanation of a useful (in my opinion) OSINT method. Adjustments would have to be made regardless, and it would be upon the 'attacker' to circumvent any presented challenges.Thanks, do feel free to add to this and tell me what you find!

5726	 Vusys	 I quite like Enpass. Most important to me is that it's cross platform and each version feels polished instead of having one good version and some shitty ports or a web interface stopgap everywhere else. I use it regularly on macOS, Linux, Windows and Android.   It has a bunch of syncing options and you could run your own if you really wanted to since it saves to your local disk.My only big gripe is none of the clients support multiple vaults which means accessing one vault for work and one for home on the same device is basically impossible.

5747	 Y783ZO22MDBQ9S2	 &gt; Do you have some sources statistics like that? Or any other insights on the matter?While not specific to GNU/Linux, here's the most common display sizes, which may be useful for mimicking.https://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_display.asp	
5748	 3WcWUFULrV85	 Use KeePass (or KeePassX/KeePassXC).* open-source and [audited](https://www.ghacks.net/2016/11/22/keepass-audit-no-critical-security-vulnerabilities-found/)* uses modern non-NIST crypto (Argon 2 KDF, ChaCha20) (sorry NSA)* minimal attack surface (only password manager Tavis Ormandy of Google Project Zero [recommends](https://twitter.com/search?l=&amp;q=keepass%20from%3Ataviso&amp;src=typd))* immune from commercially pressures that tip security balance    *  A commercial product needs to appeal to the greatest number of users (so it includes libraries to maintain compatibility with outdated browsers/OSes etc.--introducing potentially persistent vulnerabilities)    *  A commercial product has undue marketing pressure to include every bloated insecure feature its competitor introduces (leading to a bloat/insecurity arms race).    *  A commercial product tends to have a centralized point of failure, which is pretty terrifying considering Spectre/Meltdown    *  A commercial product needs to be usable by the broadest cross-section of people (i.e. usable by the least computer literate person you know). Making a product that accessible can't be done without huge security compromises. If you're even moderately computer literate, use KeePass. Make a database (using Argon2 + ChaCha20) and protect your database with a strong password **AND** a keyfile. Store your database on any cloud service of your choice (but *only manually add your key file to any device that needs it*). Don't use any plugins for KeePass (especially ones that try to integrate your password manager with your browser!).	
5749	 Y783ZO22MDBQ9S2	 Good choice, probably one of the best from what is currently offered. Cryptostorm also has some good no-log ones.	
5750	 Y783ZO22MDBQ9S2	 Depends. Anyone who wrote the FCC is dumped to Google Search. That can be especially bad for people trying to get hired, since one of the first things HR does is search your name on Google. If they are a drug-free business, they will most certainly take it into consideration.	
5751	 ki01s	 /u/Moondraper is right.  You should be able to go into your edge device (router/modem) and deny access to the WAN for the IP address you give to the camera.	
5752	 Y783ZO22MDBQ9S2	 &gt; I was given an verbal warning on not to work on opensource projects and against coding in my free time. Sounds like a really sucky company. If you are on break they cannot dictate what you do on your free time. Possible exception would be if you signed an NDA and they are afraid you will leak proprietary data. However, you should assume if using a work computer that you are being monitored, as is the network.&gt; So, does reddit know that all these accounts are used by one person?Reddit uses fingerprinting (how much we don't know, since it's no longer open source and the warrant canary died), and will definitely correlate accounts if not using Tor/you are connecting from the same IP. So, yes.. they know. Possible exception is an *r*sharedlogin and using Tor browser.Google allows you to see a small peak into [what it is doing with your data](https://www.indy100.com/article/heres-how-to-find-out-everything-google-knows-about-you--byxNll26pgl) from your My Account page.Github no doubt stores data, and commits can leak tons of juicy metadata. All depends on your threat level. If you really want to be secure, BYOD and run Tails.	
5753	 WTFEveryday	 I use 4 cheap, generic branded, Chinese-made wireless IP cameras. Yes, they do try to send information over the internet. Blocking the cameras to the Internet via firewall is one option.My solution was to utilize an old wifi router that was in disuse. I connected the 4 cameras wirelessly to this router that was not connected to the Internet.For viewing, I used a laptop with two wifi adapters on it. One on-board adapter, one USB adapter.I connected one of the adapters to my security camera network and the other to my router that has internet access.The laptop can access the cameras on the non-Internet network and I can access the laptop through the Internet connected router.Access to the laptop can be accomplished via, VPN, gotomypc, RDP, VNC, etc...A free option would be to set the cameras to record to a dropbox folder on the laptop that you can check from your phone if you don't need a live feed. The motion detection settings on the cameras should help you to not have too many videos of nothing happening.

5779	 Methmo	 Yeah, but that'll only be the tip of the iceberg. That's only the data you knowingly give them.You'd have to do a legal data request to get the "full" data they hold about you (in quotes, because they doubtless have much more semi-anonymised data about you).	
5780	 baboon_fritters	 Have somebody buy you a prepaid smart phone with cash, make an account somewhere public wifi while sitting in your car, send the email, wipe the phone,  toss the phone somewhere not near the WiFi or your home. Also be sure to be careful about the language you use writing the message as that’s the weakest link in connecting the email to you.

I would like to make the switch to Linux one of these days, but since I've been using Windows for as long as I can remember, the transition is obviously very intimidating.

5789	 PrivacyRabbit	 You limit your choices if you rule out using your phone number,  [Signal](https://www.signal.org/) ticks all your boxes, but requires your phone number. It's a free and open-source project with end-to-end encryption, and doesn't store your information. 	
5790	 ObiSi	 If you are extremely worried about fingerprinting, I think the only surefire way is to use tor or use a dedicated vm to separate the different kinds of tasks that you do(school, work, shopping). Tor is probably one of the few and most tested browsers when it comes to thwarting fingerprinting because every tor user looks the same in the default configuration. By attempting to stop fingerprinting, for instance in firefox, you instantly become unique by choosing what add-ons you are using in the attempts to block fingerprinting. Tor works because everyone using tor is following the same standard. Now if you decide to contain your browsing habits in separate vms, be aware of your IP as if you are browsing on the same IPs for all the vms, they can be correlated to identify you are the same person. When it comes to linux, I would not generally say it's any different. Linux user-agents stick out a lot because it's not a popular OS but if you throw tails or whonix on a vm, I think you'll be in pretty good shape. In regards to browser resolution, as long as you do not maximize the window, I believe it should be fine (at least with Tor) because if the window is maximized, it can determine the size of the screen. However, this is very extreme but it's the only way I know will work.

5794	 kobuta23	 it's not only the phone number that annoys me, as to be properly anonymous I would need to buy a burner sim card just to remain anonymous, it's also the fact that they want to access my phonebook.But yes, otherwise Signal is definitely a valid option.Do you know what their business model is? I am always wary of free applications. What do they live on? 	
5795	 privacyforsale	 In my opinion there is no absolutely private cloud storage, which is in reality only *someone else's computer*. I do not plan using cloud services to actual backups, instead I have physical backups. Though I am using cloud for things like school and study materials, non personal things, occasionaly.If you have to backup a file that should stay private, encrypt it! There are a couple recommended programs, Veracrypt and Cryptomator, although I haven't used them so far.That said, there are many cloud service alternatives to the almighty GDrive, Onedrive, Dropbox and iCloud. From these, only iCloud encrypts files on device before uploading AFAIK.Sync[dot]com claims your files are encrypted at rest and that they have zero knowledge. MEGA is not anymore owned by Kim Dotcom and is instead in the hands of the NZ government, as has been said on his twitter. Box[dot]com is another one, claims encryption of files at rest, but in its privacy policy is really only *one* sentence. No more details about it.There is SpiderOak, that is only paid and is serious about encryption and privacy to my knowledge.Choice is up to you really. If you truly care about privacy and want to do full data backups, buy 2 harddrives, backup your files and encrypt them with VeraCrypt. Or at least backup them, dont send them online. If you want to share something using cloud service, I think it doesn't matter which one of mentioned you use, there is always a risk. The simplest you can do is put these shared files into an archive and protect it with a password.	
5796	 kobuta23	 will look into it! Thanks for the tip

5812	 trai_dep	 &gt;The motion, which passed 60-38, virtually guarantees that the final bill will pass likely later this week and quashes any opportunity to debate whether protections should be added. Eighteen Democrats — including Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who had previously proposed an amendment to restrict the FBI’s surveillance authority — voted in support of the motion. They were joined by 41 Republicans and one independent, Angus King, giving the pro-surveillance bloc the supermajority needed to push the bill forward. Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Dan Sullivan, R-Ala., did not vote… &gt;Thirty Democrats opposed it, including minority leader Chuck Schumer, along with eight Republicans, led by libertarian Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Mike Lee R-Utah.For those keeping track at home, the breakdown on the cloture vote ending debate on renewing the 702 surveillance powers was:Democrats = 18% For, 30% Against.Republicans = 42% For, 8% Against.&gt;Tuesday’s vote was a major blow to privacy activists, who saw the sunset of NSA authority as a strategic opportunity for Congress to rein in NSA surveillance and restrict how the government can use the information it collects. “The American people deserve to have an opportunity for some real amendments to make sure, at the end of the day, we have policies that keep our people safe and protect our liberties,” said Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden.

5814	 FinnishCobweb	 I am a keepassxc user and i also use IOS. I wont lie, there isn't a decent looking keepass IOS app. The way i get around this is to only use my mobile phone for specific things. I dont know how you use your tablet and phonw, but most apps only require that you give it a password once. You can use an end-to-end encrypted messenger client like Wire to send your passwords to your other devices that will auto delete after a set time.	
5815	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
5816	 TrashMacNugget	 I would connect to a public Wi-Fi network using the Tor Browser (maybe in Tails), register an email on some site that allows anonymous registration (like [cock.li](https://cock.li/), via their Tor hidden service), maybe run it through something like Anonymouth, and send it.	
5817	 pjf72	 Good stuff mate cheers. Ok to do that on a mobile or would i need a laptop?	
5818	 FinnishCobweb	 There is no such thing as being anonymous with a mobile phone. In order for the phone to work, it needs to track your location. You can hide the true owner of it by not using it in a way that reveal such information. Wire is the messenger app i use.Try it out and see if it works for you.	
5819	 FireFlood	 Pretty heavy phone (Android) and tablet user (iOS) as opposed to desktop. Never been able to get over the keepass hump. For example, I greatly enjoy the LastPass auto-fill function.

5821	 gumnos	 I suspect that /u/WTFEveryday has it configured so that the cameras can't initiate connections to the internet, and the only way to access the cameras *from* the internet is to connect via a known-secure method such as SSH, VNC, VPN, or other such access.  Once obtaining that secured/authenticated access, only then can the cameras be accessed.	
5822	 FinnishCobweb	 You should read the failings of others before head down this road. https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xw8dm7/nsa-suspected-leaker-reality-leigh-winner-caughtAfter that, checkout https://securedrop.org/ and there recommended guide for this sort of thing.

5851	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I know all such grammar conventions and I still pull a bonehead move from time to time. Sometimes when you get caught in the passion of discussing something you forget the details. Sometimes even a reread isn't enough- the human brain is notorious for filling in details exceptionally well, so you might be understanding "your" in the context of "you're" even though they are very different words. Plus we all have weaknesses; I overuse commas generally to indicate a pause in speech (as if I were reading it), and despite knowing the difference still have to pause in order to decide between "affect" and "effect." Then there's the fact that I hate the American convention of placing sentence punctuation inside of quotation marks...Of course he owns his fuckup below in his response to you, but I comment to say that judging someone based on a *couple* grammatical errors isn't necessarily an accurate way of determining knowledge or intelligence. I can understand a slew of them leading one to a certain judgement.Yes I know that you didn't directly deride his intelligence but many such comments would be interpreted to carry that implication (especially with "basic" in the response). I think his point is nonetheless sound regardless of his "your" follies...	
5852	 PrivacyRabbit	 You're being very negative, sure, if you use stock android or iOS then there's no way of being anonymous, but with a mix of custom a OS and secure, private software, you can get as close as it is possible to be. But this discussion isn't even about being anonymous, it's about taking back a level of privacy. 	
5853	 TibetanBowlHealing	 I thought the same thing at one point.  However I've had multiple people with technological expertise tell me that transcription of many possible languages at natural speaking pace necessitates cloud transcription for parallel processing.  Siri works this way too - it will understand very basic commands like "call Mom" locally, but it will not do transcription of voice texting ("tell Mike I'm going to the store, want anything?") without an internet connection.

5857	 Julian2000nl	 You can easily self-host an XMPP server using Openfire, it comes out of the box with SSL enabled. Combine that with a DDNS Domain from your favorite DDNS host and you're up and running.I really like XMPP and just like IRC &amp; e-mail, it will never really be obsolete or abandoned because of it's simplicity and distributed way of working. If you use Jitsi Meet just for voice and video, and do all of your text over XMPP that is really the most secure and comfortable way for you and it's pretty secure. There's also this thing called Matrix but XMPP works way better and has way more users.

5877	 --Kai--	 LinkedIn is a very valuable business. There's a reason why Microsoft paid $26.2 billion for it. That's $60 per user...every single user, $60, even the ones that only used it once. It's Facebook for business professionals, great for connecting with recruiters and networking but not so great if you expect privacy. Keep exposure to it to a minimal, but it may be useful for your career to keep it around in the depths. I think the reason it easily found those names would be email contacts. Most people probably let LinkedIn bite into their email contacts, where you'd be.	
5878	 ExternalUserError	 IMO, 1Password is really only a viable option if you're on a Mac. Granted, there are clients on other platforms, but they aren't feature-complete. For example, you can't even export your database without a Mac.

5883	 ExternalUserError	 LastPass scares the shit out of me. All they have to do is deliver one bad payload, once, and you're compromised. Granted, things like ProtonMail work that way too, but a password manager is uniquely sensitive.Here's my list of alternatives. Sorry, I don't have time to link to them all, you can find them.* KeePass/Keepass2/etc. I've personally found that it's not the most elegantly designed, but KeePassX worked well for me when I used it. For synchronization, just use Dropbox or Google Drive. The database is encrypted. Having said that, KeePassXC  (a fork) kept generating corrupt databases for me, so yikes.* 1Password -- acceptable Mac option if you don't mind proprietary code. I'm not a big fan of how they're moving from local storage to cloud storage, but for the time being, you can still use a local vault you synchronize with your phone over *local* wifi (still encrypted), which is great.* Pass (for Unix CLI users) (https://www.passwordstore.org) -- great command line utility, but your list of logins itself isn't encrypted and the GUI options (like qtpass) are shitty.* Enpass -- like 1password, but more cross-platform. Bad because it's not really audited by any third parties, good because the price is reasonable (they only charge for mobile), the GUI is pretty good, and it has nice features.* mooltipass -- a hardware password manager that uses smartcards. Pretty cool, but when I tested it, almost all my smartcards are reported as corrupt.

5905	 SLEEP_IS_GOOD	 deliveroo handles customer phone numbers and delivery drivers phone numbers in a nice way. calls are redirected through an exchange so the number the driver calls or the number the customer calls is for deliveroo, no personal number revealed and the link between both parties disappears once the job is complete. nothing you can do about customers addresses though, obviously.	
5906	 atempt55	 This post and the tweet are very misleading.  They can request a warrant to search your house and electronic devices if they have probable cause that leads them to believe you committed a crime using a computer.  In this case, Mr. Piffer was accused of digitally creating and print off flyers that were meant to impersonate police officers and intimidate a witness.  The probable cause was supported by the totality of circumstances surrounding the crime and the connection between this crime and another crime Mr. Piffer was a part of. It is reasonable to assume if Mr. Piffer did create and print those flyers using a computer, the computer and related storage devices would be located at his residence.   Any person would find this to be reasonable.

5915	 nitrohorse	 [Looks like its on their roadmap](https://github.com/bitwarden/core/issues/27) but no estimate when.	
5916	 fan222	 I disagree. It requires "assuming" that he printed the flyers using a home computer. All the cops knew was that he printed flyers and letters. They didn't know that he had a computer at home, or a printer, or even that he owned one of those devices. I don't think it is reasonable to assume that because someone uses a printed piece of paper in a crime, there is a reasonable probability that there is evidence of a crime in his house.	
5917	 annadane	 privacytools.io is fine but it can maybe be a little dense to read at times.	
5918	 fan222	 Also, not "very misleading." The opinion states that "no assertion was made that Mr. Peffer owned either a computer or a printer or, if he did, that he kept those items at the Bierri Road residence." Then, the court decided: "If an affidavit presents probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed by means of an object, ... a magistrate may presume that there is a nexus between that object and the suspect’s current residence, unless the affidavit contains facts that may rebut that presumption."So, unless somehow there's reason to believe otherwise, your mere use of a word processor in a crime gives rise to PC to search your house.	
5919	 fan222	 Although the court cited the "totality of the circumstances" test, its analysis of the computer issue didn't rest on that test. I agree that there were lots of ways to decide the case on more narrow grounds. But I don't agree that everybody thinks its reasonable to search Mr. Pfeffer's home because he printed flyers (especially without any evidence he printed them at home).

5921	 TibetanBowlHealing	 The solution may be on a desktop, but the transcription is done in the cloud.  I dug a little deeper on the website to find [this marketing PDF](https://www.nuance.com/content/dam/nuance/en_us/collateral/healthcare/case-study/cs-nuance-partners-with-microsoft-azure-for-a-secure-reliable-cloud-infrastructure-en-us.pdf):&gt;To address this challenge, Nuance introduced the industry’s first cloudbased, medical speech recognition platform in 2011. This solution took its place alongside the company’s boxed-software and network versions of Dragon Medical. &gt; With Dragon Medical One running in Azure, Nuance can deliver its speech recognition software with great responsiveness and performance across devices, including thin client and virtual deployments. “Hospitals are shifting their IT deployments and making use of virtualization technology,” Dreyer says. “By moving that heavy processing workload to Azure, our software thatruns on the client network is very light.” &gt; Another benefit of running Dragon Medical One in the cloud: Nuance can more easily update its software and keep it current for clients while rolling out innovations as soon as its R&amp;D team creates them.

5929	 atempt55	 If the police know I murdered someone with a gun, it would be reasonable to assume the gun could be found within my home.  That would be enough for a warrant to search my house.  When it comes to guns, because we “have acknowledged that individuals who own guns keep them at their homes,” United States v. Smith, 182 F.3d 473, 480 (6th Cir. 1999), a suspect’s use of a gun in the commission of a crime is sufficient to find a nexus between the gun that was used  and  the  suspect’s  residence.   In this case, it was well within reason to assume the computer that was used to design the flyers would most likely be in the suspects house.  They do not need to prove he owned a computer, just like if I murder someone with a gun; they do not need to prove I own guns or even store guns in my house to search it for the murder weapon.  A warrant boils down to this.  "If this person committed a crime, we will most likely find evidence of said crime by searching for these specific types of items/evidence in this specific place"  and then that warrant has to be backed up with testimony and other evidence to be issued (probable cause).

Not sure about the fact that it is centralized.Considering they also offer synchronization between device, I am guessing the store all conversations on these central servers.Complete anonymity may be impossible, but pseudonymity is possible. This is something that you can do also by using a burner sim card when registering with Signal. The problem is it causes a series of problems afterwards with account retrieval, identification, etc.I agree that complete anonymity is almost impossible, as is security. One has to try and do the best they can without going to live in a cave. How would you keep anonymous from the company itself (Wire Swiss GmbH) if you are paying them a subscription?	
5942	 kobuta23	 Wire seems good. Not sure about the fact that it is a centralized solution.

Possible exception would be if you signed an NDA and they are afraid you will leak proprietary data. However, you should assume if using a work computer that you are being monitored, as is the network.It gets even suckier. No NDA or proprietary thing. When I joined, my manager wanted to friend me in Facebook, instagram, twitter &amp; reddit, I did not think much of it at the time and my github was on my CV. Then he watches all our activities in social media.

The shit was I was given for using Bootstrap at for a demo that I made 2 yrs back, was just senseless. The manager is a microsoft fan boy and I got mocked for installing sublime text at work. Now he is using VS code. I am currently learning VIM and I am just imagine the rant he is going to start if he finds out of that.

5949	 potatoclip	 The layout is slightly confusing. It has many good guides but e.g. bundling browser privacy settings instead of making a separate guide is silly. For beginners the advice is: Use Tor Browser. If the site you're using doesn't accept connections over Tor, **then** use normal browser and consider using VPN, browser privacy addons and tweaking it's settings for increased privacy. Recommendation for Ubuntu isn't included either which is strange. It's probably the easiest platform for novices due to large community and help platform, and no longer contains privacy issues. But other than that it's a decent guide and I have no issues with it's recommendations.

Most companies see every marketing tactic and violation of ethics and laws as an investment, and if the return of investment (ROI) is positive (after substracting the estimated losses from court battles etc.), they see it as worth doing.

Google make almost all their money from abusing your personal information to sell ads, Microsoft make their money from selling services like Office 365 and Xbox Live. Google is inheritantly anti privacy, the less privacy people have the more money they rake in. They’re worse than Facebook, the only mail provider to read your email. Android spies on your 24/7 location even if you opt out, turn off location and remove your SIM card. Nobody does spyware like Google, youd have to be stupid to defend it.

5976	 FinnishCobweb	 Wire for personal use is free and is what i use. There is metadata about who you communicate with, however your conversions are protected via end-to-end encryption and forward secrecy. If you and the party you are communicating with apply good opsec, then anyone looking at this metadata wont easily decipher who is talking to who.One way you can set this up is to create an email account from an IP address that's not yours. I would use a proxy guard like whonix to connect to a free vpn, then create a protonmail email account since they are no longer tor friendly. Using the same whonix proxy, you create a Wire account under a persona that is not link to you in anyway. If the person you are communicating with follow the same process and you both only contact each other behind whonix, then figuring out who you are will be a order of magnitude much difficult. This is of course assuming you are not already under surveillance. This type of setup is only useful if you actually need it. No point in doing this just to talk to you parents.

We are starting out with a centralized server in Iceland but we are planning to develop a decentralized architecture that will also help us to develop some form of IP obfuscation.The app is engineered for anonymity. We won't be asking for a phone number when signing up, and won't ask for phonebook permissions as users are identified solely by a serial number on their license.You will not be distributing the app on any app stores, so there won't be a list of users in anyone's hands.And our main innovation is actually something else: we are developing an external hardware device that will add an extra layer of encryption for your messages. This device will feature a custom FPGA chip that will handle all the encryption, designed and manufactured by us to ensure there are no backdoors. All messages, files, audio etc. sent when using the device will not be readable when the device is disconnected, giving you a 2FA of sorts if your phone is stolenIf you are interest, visit our website http://crip.to for more information, or visit our subreddit /r/crip_to

5985	 kobuta23	 It would be good if that metadata wasn't there to start with. One can always trust their own security, but the problem with messaging is that both parties have to be careful or it can easily fail, that is why a system that is secure and private by default would be so valuable (and seems to be hard to find!) Will definitely look into it and give it a spin! Thanks for the suggestion!	
5986	 hlwogemk	 I'm no expert but I'm in a similar situation. Try [contacting IG here] (https://help.instagram.com/contact/151081798582137?helpref=faq_content) to report that your email is being used but you didn't create the account. It will take a day or so for IG to reply and verify you are the owner of the account. They should then remove the email from that person's IG (but oddly enough, they won't close their account..I guess they do that in case it was a mistake?).    Awhile back, I got a welcome email showing that someone had created a new Instagram account using an old email of mine. IIRC, I think I tried to report the user or something to try and get IG to close their account. Several months later, I saw that the profile was still up. I tried to create a new IG to see if they had removed the email, but it was still in use. So I contacted IG via the link above and they finally removed it but the other person's IG is still active. I made a throwaway IG with my email address so that the person can't use it again. Got another message from IG recently for an attempted login (they were probably trying to get into their account using my email as sign in still). In my case, however, they are also trying to access my actual email too. I've had a few unsuccessful IMAP syncs from another country on my email logs for the past several months but today it just clicked that it's the probably the same person trying to log in (same date, around the same time). Other than to keep changing the password, using 2FA, etc. not sure how to shake them.        Keep checking your email logs. Hope they aren't doing the same. Good luck!

You, I and everyone else has been sold a "bill of goods" on democracy by the elected leaders, the lifelong gov't employees that they work so very hard to represent and the capitalist giants. Most of Anonymous has been working hard to get the word out on the renewal of this bill and it seems as if no one seems to care how deeply these individuals are willing to crawl up each of our respective asses. Please let us all become more involved on a day to day basis in keeping track of their actions and holding them accountable one election at a time. Take a moment and consider why you might be so angry that someone would cut in front of you driving to work today yet at the same time be so complacent about your country's elected leaders taking systematic steps to eliminate your personal freedoms.

5998	 metiis	 Yes, but there is a small difference between companies monitoring their **adult** employees, who are paid to **work** for them, being monitored **only at work**, and **children** who likely don't even know the implications of the software their parents impose having zero privacy from their parents, **at any time, inescapably**, except when they turn off their internet connection **permanently**.I think doing this to your child does more harm than good, keeping secrets from your parents is part of growing up, and if it isn't illegal, it should be.	
5999	 frasier2122	 Then I guess you just don't like our 4A jurisprudence. The issue, IMO, is whether, when searching the computer for evidence that it was used to create / manufacturer the flyers, the investigators have a broad plain view scope to search the entire machine. By analogy to searching a house, if the police had a warrant to search for evidence of flyer printing (via a physical, type-set printing press), then evidence would not be admissible if it were found in hiding places where it would not be possible / reasonable for the stated evidence to hidden. E.g., wouldn't be valid to search a medicine cabinet in the upstairs bathroom, if the printing press and all tools are in the basement. But on a computer, it's at least a little more reasonable for the forensic investigators to presume that files could be hidden anywhere, and so I expect that literally the entire hard drive is within the plain view scope.

6008	 shades9323	 For iPhone/iPad I use MiniKeePass.	
6009	 shades9323	 What is it you don't like about minikeepass?	
6010	 3WcWUFULrV85	 I use Keepass2Android. The most important thing in Android is to use an app that has its own keyboard (and switch to that keyboard for inputting passwords). Any copy-paste operations are globally accessible by any (malicious) app on your phone. Android Oreo has a new autofill API that should address the security issues (Keepass2Android supports the new API). 	
6011	 3WcWUFULrV85	 I use Keepass (or Keepass + mono for linux).You could try KeepassXC, which is more actively developed these days. 	
6012	 CloudBerryBackup	 IMHO, also worth mentioning: BackBlaze, Wasabi and Minio.First two have pretty fair pricing, while Minio is a self-hosted storage solution.As for the encryption - it is always better to have some backup software that will encrypt it locally prior to upload.	
6013	 fan222	 The last part of what you said isn't correct. Just because there's evidence someone committed a crime, it doesn't justify a search of their home. That's the difference between an arrest warrant and a search warrant. They likely had probable cause to arrest Peffer, but that doesn't = PC to search his home.  See Steagald v. United States, 451 U.S. 204, 212-13 (1981); United States v. Griffith, 867 F.3d 1265, 1271 (D.C. Cir. 2017).There has to be some nexus between the alleged crime and the place to be searched. The court here found that it was enough of a nexus that a person sent flyers that "appeared to be" computer generated.Even if this is correct, it is still "strikingly broad" as the tweet says. Especially since there appears to have been other ways reach a decision upholding PC in the case. I'm not saying the warrant didn't establish PC, but saying any possible computer use (i.e. computer generated documents) is enough for a home search is very broad.	
6014	 Kotee_ivanovich	 Is this site had info only about who lives in usa?	
6015	 FroMan753	 Thats a fair point. But would it still be possible for them to track you if you just access Google Drive through a browser?	
6016	 fan222	 I don't like our 4A jurisprudence. That's true. But this takes a step beyond what the jurisprudence had found so far. In fact, the opinion acknowledges that there are courts that disagree with some aspects of the panel's ruling that there is a presumption that an object used in a crime will be found in the home of the person who used that object.Many court decisions require stricter enforcement of the "nexus" requirement between the crime and the location of the evidence sought. So that police wouldn't be able to conduct a home search just because they found printed flyers a person used in a crime, at least without conducting some additional investigation.	
6017	 LizMcIntyre	 Thoughts on the privacy of this app?	
6018	 lolbertarian4america	 I just recently jumped ship from iPhone back to Android.  I'm an early adopter and fan of both platforms, but iOS 11 is an absolute disaster and a sign of how low Apple's quality control has fallen.  What's the point of dealing with a walled garden when it doesn't work correctly, there's no way to fix it AND you have to deal with idiotic rules like what OP posted?Not that Google exactly has the best track record with privacy, but shit get a decent phone and at least the stupid thing works properly and lets you work on it like you own it......	
6019	 FroMan753	 Open source means anyone can audit it at anytime. You're having to trust that 1Password hasn't made any changes since their last security audit. Bitwarden also has self-hosting options.	
6020	 wk8dtb	 Disable RES and check if you still see the links. If so, then delete all of your browsers cache/cookies then check again.	
6021	 lordnahte2	 Net neutrality *under title II* may have only been around for 3 years, but the internet was originally built upon the phone lines, which already had strong neutrality rules put in place. The idea that net neutrality is a new thing is patently false.	
6022	 Methmo	 &gt; and lets you work on it like you own it......Make sure you avoid Samsung then, their latest phones I've heard are very difficult to root (as in, there is a hardware switch which is triggered if you attempt to root it, which you can't reset, and which voids your warranty).	
6023	 lordnahte2	 If you're using the same computer and browser each time, it's likely tracking through the cache and cookies. It's super common to track users through those.	
6024	 vivekkhera	 There is a bootable CD developed for use by journalists to collect whistle blower tips safely. I do not know if you can use that.

6026	 RedditIsDogShit	 Rooting android phones is not a smart thing to do in terms of security. You could have apps or malware with root permission running without your knowledge. Often a rooted phone will not recieve security updates from the manufacturer. These factors combined makes a rooted phone easy for other people to maliciously access.

6031	 IsopropylWick	  This is why you root it and change ROM for a rom that will be updated	
6032	 ado010	 &gt; You could have apps or malware with root permission running without your knowledge.How would this happen when I have to grant access to root for each app?	
6033	 Z4KJ0N3S	 &gt;Rooting android phones is not a smart thing to do in terms of security. You could have apps or malware with root permission running without your knowledge. Often a rooted phone will not recieve security updates from the manufacturer. These factors combined makes a rooted phone easy for other people to maliciously access.If you're rooting a phone, these are the 'risks' you know you're taking. Yes, you need to rely on your ROM developer for updates, big whoop. You can also just be running your phone's official ROM with root, too. ALL sudo-management apps prompt the user allow/disallow when an app tries to run as root. You *cannot* have apps running as root without your knowledge, unless you're deliberately, willfully ignorant of them.Rooting your Android phone is perfectly safe unless you're a complete moron who shouldn't be doing it in the first place.	
6034	 RedditIsDogShit	 Do you trust the security of the ROM? Perhaps it could be trusted if it's open-source, but the rooting evades bootloader security.	
6035	 bigolmonkeyfarm	 After that IOS update, my iphone has gone to shit. It is much slower and my phone now does this thing where the touch screen will freeze and then start doing wonky shit. It will text random people nonsense, FaceTime people out of the blue. There have been 2 instances now while in class (mind you a 100 person college lecture) where my phone has opened up a video or Spotify while in my back pack and the sound was on full blast.   God forbid if it were to ever play porn... I keep my phone 100% off during lectures because I don’t trust it. Also there was a time when my phone bugged out and took a picture of me on Snapchat while I was peeing and sent it to my best friends older brother.I don’t know if that’s related to the IOS update but this phone isn’t cracked, no water exposure... if Apple admitted to slowing down phones who knows what else they could have coded into IOS 11 and beyond to make our phones shittier.

6040	 FroMan753	 Aren't Keepass databases automatically encrypted by default? Is there really any benefit to encrypting it again?	
6041	 CyborgPurge	 As an app developer, very legitimate apps often get rejected for seemingly no reason because of reviewer bias or because the reviewer simply doesn't understand the app's purpose. Often times just resubmitting it again will get you through.	
6042	 skidmark-steve	 On the flipside, there is plenty of evidence that the government in the US spies on us (Americans).Examples: Snowden disclosures, Mark Klein/Room641A, the way they vehemently argued that these systems are not used against Americans when the stories broke, but are now trying to codify the practice...Anyway, if I wanted a Huawei phone, US carriers not offering them would not stop me from getting one one bit. I did actually look at that brand when selecting the most recent device. You should not be buying phones from the big carriers anyway. That's because they pre-load phones with lots of bloatware, they sometimes restrict features that conflict with business interests (like limiting tethering), and the carriers also make it even less likely that you will get timely Android updates, if any at all.	
6043	 TeaRex-	 &gt;	Also there was a time when my phone bugged out and took a picture of me on Snapchat while I was peeing and sent it to my best friends older brother.I have problems with snapchat too but that seems a bit... um.... much?	
6044	 Disclandr	 This is same as how US Govt threw bad publicity at Kaspersky Antivirus.  I am surprised that they can get away with libelous slander like this that causes financial harm to these companies.  	
6045	 TheVeryMask	 For that matter, a granular permissions manager like XPrivacy is something you *cannot* have without root. You are much less safe without root from malicious apps.	
6046	 bigolmonkeyfarm	 Well, it happened. It took a picture of my legs with my pants down, and then sent it to her bro. This phone will literally tweak out and random buttons on the screen will be pressed without any actual touch- it wasn’t Snapchat that was the issue. Edit: If this is getting down-voted because it sounds too unbelievable that’s incredibly annoying. 	
6047	 skylarmt	 The only thing "bootloader security" does is check if the installed OS came from an approved source.	
6048	 PrivacyRabbit	 Here's a list of countries where key disclosure laws do and do not apply: https://www.privacytools.io/#kdlWith the current political shift in Poland, I would recommend against moving there. Key disclosure laws may not currently apply, but they may soon. 	
6049	 Disclandr	 I know right?  I tried KeepassXC over a year ago and the import from Lastpass csv function failed.  Now tried it again 2 weeks ago and exact same error.  Its amazing the incompetence of these devs that even 1 year later they still cants get the import from LastPass correctly (a simple csv file).I thought about it and said "Can I really trust this software with all my logins?"      	
6050	 paulhunter32	 Totally agree. It's sad that many people aren't willing to invest a few bucks in their privacy and use Threema."	
6051	 skylarmt	 Looks like it just downloads test files from a server and reports the anonymous results.	
6052	 Disclandr	 Lastpass has the largest market share out of all password managers by far.Therefore it makes them a tremendous honeypot and an attractive target for hackers.  Just like all the hommies in da hood know that the armored truck at the bank is "full of money" so too do the hackers know that the ultimate target is the LastPass server that is chock-full of login information (and also the dum-dums that save credit card numbers and social security number inside Lastpass too)All cloud-based password managers are a problem if they store all your passwords on the cloud instead of on your local machine.  But lastpass is such a handsome target and has already been breached and hacked on multiple occasions.  I switched to Enpass because it does not save my logins on the cloud   	
6053	 BitcoinSlayer	 Thanks, see that's my fear.. eventually all countries will require you to disclose keys, which is why I was looking at a hidden OS setup, but im not sure now after reading the LUKS documentation and other links I provided.What about Italy and Spain? I can't find them on any lists.	
6054	 noflag	 I wish it was that easy. I can't unlock my g7 no matter what. I don't even have a warranty, I buy used	
6055	 NotoriousArab	 That's too much power (abuse) for them to give up. Because what *really* directly benefits their users, is leaving Apple's walled "garden", both financially and technologically. 	
6056	 Disclandr	 I agree, I am enjoying Enpass also.  Its a free service and only have to pay $10 for the android app as a one time lifetime fee.  And after that you are set for life.  Compare that to Lastpass $24 per year or the others that are all even more expensive.  And the Lastpass import tool actually works (unlike KeePass).  I have over 400 items in my vault that I would have to type in one by one if I wanted to use KeePass   	
6057	 Disclandr	 Also mark my words that LastPass is going to take away the free option of 2fa on the free version.  So after that it will be almost compulsory to upgrade to the LastPass $24 per year plan.  	
6058	 KRZ_759	 Better than Gmail != actually good	
6059	 JackDostoevsky	 While I don't disagree with your assessment on iOS, I legitimately feel more comfortable with Apple at the helm than Google. Not that I really trust *either* company, it's just... Apple definitely has a better track record.That said, the desire to move back to an Android device + LineageOS (nee CyanogenMod) + microG (so I can get Signal) is mighty tempting.	
6060	 Tib5	 I actually never heard of Threema, looks interesting. That mandatory £3 price tag, ain't that welcoming though. Sadly, people who have smartphones don't like paying up front, and even fewer seem to pay for apps/games in the store directly (I learnt that the hard way). If only it had a free version, and maybe a payment model for those who wish to contribute.	
6061	 openRUSE	 Someone once told me XPrivacy had issues but they didn't expand on that at all so who knows if it was legit	
6062	 [deleted]	 &gt; Not that Google exactly has the best track record with privacyHow so? You mean in regards to collecting your data or not securing it? Because Apple sure as fuck collects all that data on you as well. Both have had security breaches in the past but Apple is a little more forthcoming with it's stance on privacy. Both cooperate with the government in necessary cases. Can you clarify?	
6063	 TeaRex-	 That sounds like a hardware issue and not a software issue. Maybe the touch screen connector got loose and now it sends random touch events?

6067	 metiis	 It's still proprietary software. Who knows what Microsoft built into the new feature? Microsoft can't be trusted with your data, no matter if it's allegedly end-to-end encrypted or not. As long as a program is closed source, it has the potential to, and probably does, collect any data it can get.	
6068	 FvDijk	 I made a tradeoff between security and convenience here. My few most important passwords are in a Keepass vault and on paper in a safe physical location without user names/websites (I had a corrupted database once, so I needed a contingency). I also carry the database with me on my keychain.The passwords that won't hurt me much when I lose them are in Lastpass. That way I can still access the bulk of my accounts with ease, but the important ones aren't available through that option.

6072	 thebardingreen	 Bro do you even Copperhead?	
6073	 popepeterjames	 Because it makes the carriers that resell their phones look bad (because they are bad... but it shines the light on the issue)... and they don't want to piss off retailers that sell their devices.They are protecting their own corporate intereststs.  What they are really saying is that it has no direct benefit to Apple.Remember that you, like the device, are the product.	
6074	 3WcWUFULrV85	 Sounds like a sane compromise. Couple that with using 2FA whenever available, and you're pretty well set. 	
6075	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Torbrowser is the only real chance you have at concealing who you are. Even better if Torbrowser is running on a virtual machine so that hardware cannot be determined (barring meltdown/spectre exploits). Whonix is probably the best way to do this, but I could be wrong.I've never used this account outside my Whonix VM fwiw...	
6076	 skidmark-steve	 The "problem" with hidden volumes is that we are hurtling towards a dystopia where users can be compelled to provide passwords. In some cases, we are already at this point. The thing about hidden volumes is that there's no way to prove whether they exist or not. And so authorities are probably not going to believe a user when he says none exist, just like they won't believe you if you say that you forgot the password.And since the user can't actually prove that there isn't a hidden volume, he's fucked. The software supports hidden volumes, so "clearly he is using one". And since the user won't unlock it, he can "sit in jail until he remembers" how to unlock something that doesn't actually exist.	
6077	 PrivacyRabbit	 Italy and Spain, while not on the list, are inside the EU, if looking for privacy, the EU is inadvisable, as their governments are bound by US like gag orders, meaning companies could be forced to give up your data and not inform you.  Switzerland is probably one of your safest options, with some of the strongest laws surrounding user privacy in the world - Being outside of US and EU control, requests for data must go through open Swiss courts.

I remember a few years ago someone had released a WebSockets fork that was available on F-Droid, but moxie got (probably justifiably) upset about it because that app used the official OWS servers and he felt like they were piggybacking on them.But he did call for someone to merge WebSockets into the main project, so I'm glad to hear that they did!

6094	 BitcoinSlayer	 So if I stay inside US and EU I should look for a hidden volume setup? I dont know if it's safe.	
6095	 AlbertoAru	 &gt;Regulators could oblige platform firms to make anonymised bulk data available to competitors, in return for a fee, a bit like the compulsory licensing of a patent. Such data-sharing requirements could be calibrated to firms’ size: the bigger platforms are, the more they have to share. These mechanisms would turn data from something titans hoard, to suppress competition, into something users share, to foster innovation.I wonder, what if I own a huge company but I create from nothing a small company and I want Google to share all of this anonymous information with my small company? Can I use this data with my huge company?	
6096	 BitcoinSlayer	 Well what's the point of encryption then? you are saying whether you give a password that opens a volume where you store things for plausible deniability or you claim you don't remember any passwords, you are fucked either way.. so?	
6097	 JavierTheNormal	 And I wish Vice writers were unemployed.

6101	 BitcoinSlayer	 Also, could you tell me what Linux distro to install to use LUKS? I wanted Xubuntu, but this worried me:https://gitlab.com/cryptsetup/cryptsetup/wikis/FrequentlyAskedQuestions&gt;UBUNTU INSTALLER: In particular the Ubuntu installer seems to be quite willing to kill LUKS containers in several different ways. Those responsible at Ubuntu seem not to care very much (it is very easy to recognize a LUKS container), so treat the process of installing Ubuntu as a severe hazard to any LUKS container you may have.Does this mean I should not use any Ubuntu based distro? I have never used anything other than Ubuntu based distros.And I would also like to know, what's the best way to totally wipe a disk before installing an OS and encrypting it.I was considering partition magic and use secure erase with it, what do you think?

6111	 Zephyreks	 Meanwhile the NSA is sitting on heaps of exploits that could have been used... The FBI's move was posturing to try and get Apple to concede to government demands publically. Plain and simple. They likely already have access to the servers and have backdoors into the software, but it's not yet entirely legal... 	
6112	 DavidMc0	 This is great. I'm looking forward to the SafeCoin video that's going to be produced by the same people, but will focus on the crypto currency aspects of the SAFE network, which are fantastic (almost instant, very cheap, massively scalable, backed by computer resources)  and the reason I became interested in the project in the first place.	
6113	 SotRos25	 Basically, as a blockchain-based solution, Substratum can only secure the pointer to the data, and not the data itself. It’s like Substratum is a really good lock, but (to extend the metaphor) someone could come through the “wall” instead of the “door” to steal your treasure (i.e., data). Moreover, due to blockchain’s limitations, Substratum could never store massive amounts of data because blockchains are built to be immutable ledgers not storage containers. Maidsafe, on the other hand, not only provides a good lock, but also puts your treasure in another, limitless dimension where no one can find it.

6133	 GotRedditFever	 You can root but when you flash the stock ROM again. Or use some banking apps in rooted version or stock they won't work. You also lose Samsung Pay and Secret folder.	
6134	 JimRaynor56	 App rollouts can take up to 24 hours due to caching, so unless someone finds it and posts a link, or the dev does it, we're stuck waiting for it to show up. This is pretty normal for the app store though. 	
6135	 Houle168	 Anyone have the link to the app... can’t find it..	
6136	 jawz101	 This doesn't really make any sense as a way to test.  The app itself could adjust its own quality independent of the carrier.  Additionally, you'd have to prove it originated from the same IP during the whole test.  If a video file is played on one server one moment, you stop and start the test and it pulls from a different cloud server- that's not a very accurate way to determine throttling.  Too many moving parts.  And some of these services offer [caching servers for FREE](https://openconnect.netflix.com/en/) to ISP's to host content in-network.  I assume this is why T-Mobile does their unlimited Netflix bonus.  Meaning they can serve most of the Netflix content closer to you so they don't have to have to route big video files all around the country to simply serve you a video.	
6137	 Garylauper	 That's a good point, though I wonder if the proportion of people buying laptops for others is fairly small. I'm not sure if current algorithms would take this into account, but I can imagine deep learning factoring in this kind of probability	
6138	 Garylauper	 Great link, thanks. I suppose that is somewhat deeper than sophisticated browser fingerprinting techniques, but could theoretically be used to match up with that. Unless broswer fingerprinting is that advanced now. I'm dual-booting at the moment but if the IDs won't follow between OSs then that's good. I will keep compartmentalising for the moment! And not link anything personal to the new machine.

6142	 Disclandr	 I agree, there is no private cloud provider.  Thats like sticking your stuff in Public Storage, they can look inside your unit anytime they want to.  The most private cloud is an external hard drive that you backup to it once per week and then store it in a fireproof case.  ($40 on Amazon for the fireproof case)

6154	 JeffersonsSpirit	 A good point! As the article mentions, this is useless on its own- it requires other accounts or website input data owned by the same company (or companies sharing this data for whatever reason). I have to wonder as well: could this be defeated by typing into a text editor and then copy pasting into the input field of a given website? They can't profile typing patterns if there *are* no typing patterns. I would imagine there would have to be many users taking this approach for it to be effective.Its scary how much effort anonymity takes, and how its getting harder as time goes on.

6157	 humanmanguy	 Google just always tries to be too smart for its own good. Which fails more often then not because, more often then not, they're really fucking stupid.In the case of the shitpool that is the Google Playstore, that's just the result of them trying to rely on AI to police the content rather than actual human beings.For what purpose? I don't know. They probably aren't even too sure about it themselves.Do they want to have tight control over everything to ensure quality? Because they've been failing miserably at that with their current strategy.Do they want to give consumers more choices by avoiding the locked-down situation on the iOS side? Then why did they lock down Android and completely fuck over the promises of open source they made when it was first released? And to make matters worse, they've been working on a new custom kernel to replace the open source linux one. So even if they release it under an open source license, they'll have no legal obligation whatsoever to release their own contributions to it. So they've built their massively successful operating system on the back of the open source community, only to end up fucking it over.My personal opinion is that the Google we knew and loved died when the founders left. Now it's just another giant multinational that exists solely to build shareholder wealth in endless mediocrity, rather than actually try to innovate and, you know, do the stuff that made them successful in the first place.	
6158	 humanmanguy	 If you send someone a "signed" message along with a public key, that person has no way of verifying that the public key actually belongs to *you*. This isn't usually a problem if you're emailing people you know, as you could share your key with them beforehand.For sending a signed email to a stranger, you need to somehow providing them with your public key in a way that they can be 100% sure it belongs to you. The way most people do it is by putting their public key on their personal website. If you don't have a website, maybe you can get away with putting it on some social media account that is verified to be yours.

6163	 MagicGin	 &gt; My personal opinion is that the Google we knew and loved died when the founders leftGoogle "died" the moment they became the dominant advertising force on the internet. The vast majority of their money is made from advertising and, as a result, there's no incentive for them to improve or offer new products. This is why they constantly develop half-baked garbage and drop things at random with no warning; none of it matters to them. Adsense is fine. Gmail is fine. "Google" isn't going anywhere, so why would the CEOs give a shit if a manager fails to deliver big results? Better to keep him than find a new one. Why would the managers give a shit if a product is a bust? They're not going to get punished. So there's no coherency or direction in their model, because there's no reason to exert that kind of control. The result is shit like android, where some things are great and others are garbage. That's the Google Way.Google was never really a "lovable" business. They just no longer give a shit because they're too dominant to collapse. As long as advertising on the internet exists, so will Google.

6165	 g_squidman	 Ha ha I like to think a bunch of pedophiles who didn't get the reference all jumped on Google when they saw my comment. 	
6166	 humanmanguy	 Not really. At least for me, I loved Google back in the day, during the early days of Android specifically because they were making really awesome products *even though* their business relied completely on advertising. Without Google there never would've been a commercially-successful open source operating system for smartphones, the most popular computing devices on the planet. It felt like their "don't be evil" motto actually meant something, and that I could invest myself in their platform and products (I starting Android development from the first day I got my G1).Sure, now we know that their intentions were to fuck everyone over (or maybe things changed along the way), but Google was definitely a great company back in the day.

6175	 Tib5	 Incognito Mode, Private Browsing, or whatever you want to call it, in theory is a way to help you remain private.That's "in theory" though. In truth you still need to be careful of a few things:* These more private browser modes tend to store that data (cookie, history, or otherwise), and delete it once that browser session has been closed. That means it will behave like a normal browser, and shouldn't (in the process) break some sites like proper blocking software would.* If you're going to be using a service, yes, it will be tracking you. For example, if you type something into Google, that information is then saved on their servers when it logs (and analyses) your enquiry, so it will still be tracking you. Sadly, their's nothing you can do about that aside from not using that service. I suggest taking a look at [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com/) instead of Google, for instance.If you really want to invest in privacy, try using some privacy focused extensions/add-ons. I suggest taking a look at:* Cookie AutoDelete = This should automatically delete the saved cookie once you leave the website, or close the tab.* UBlock Origin = This should block some scripts, ads, and a few optional things like pop-ups and remote fonts.* Privacy Badger = This is easily a more advanced tool, that will block a lot of scripts found on websites (including tracking). I encourage you to experiment with controlling it yourself, and not let it's algorithm sort everything out, as you'll eventually get better results, but even with just the algorithm it's still pretty good.* HTTPS Everywhere = Something to help force sites use HTTPS, which surprisingly some sites still don't do automatically.Lastly, if you really want to look into being more secure/private, maybe take a look at some of the "free" services you're using (like Gmail, Facebook and WhatsApp) and finding a more (paid for) private alternative (like ProtonMail and Signal).I think that pretty much covers everything, it's getting pretty late so for me so I apologize if I missed something out, and any potential typing errors.**UPDATE:**It doesn't always matter if you're logged in. Companies can still know it's you by looking at your IP address, using your smartphone (or any smart device) that's been connected to your home and work WiFi, GPS data, and so on.

6181	 BitcoinSlayer	 Going back to the hidden OS idea... can it lead to bugs that could reveal the contents? or worst case scenario is they could find there's a hidden volume?I mean it was my initial idea, to have 2 OS with 2 passwords, but im not sure anymore, specially after reading there was a bug that could make it possible to find out there was a hidden volume, because in that case you can't claim you forgot the pass.And by the way, can they know when was the last time you accessed the disk? because on that case, what's the point of pretending you forgot the password? if you accessed recently they would know.

In the instant case, a suspect’s home was searched because the alleged crime involved computer-generated flyers… &gt;Here, law enforcement made no effort to so much as suggest that the suspect owned a computer, electronic storage device, or printer; instead, they assumed that if he did have one and had used it in a crime it would be in his home. *Almost every home would be fair game if this pernicious reasoning were to spread.*Note also, this opinion was written by a newly-appointed judge to the Sixth Circuit, John K. Bush. As the Slate article notes,&gt;On Wednesday, Bush handed down his first published opinion in a constitutional case, Peffer v. Stephens. He used the occasion to create a new rule that guts the Fourth Amendment’s protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. In an astonishingly broad decision, Bush held that if a suspect *may* have used his home computer in commission of a crime [printing fliers that were anonymously distributed around town], law enforcement officials have probable cause to search his entire house.

Apple asked Choffnes to provide a technical description of how his app is able to detect if wireless telecom providers throttle certain types of data, and 18 hours after he did, the app was approved.&gt;"The conversation was very pleasant, but did not provide any insight into the review process [that] led the app to be rejected in the first place," Choffnes told us in an email.

6205	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I use StartPage part of the time as my search engine which itself uses Google. I don't do anything I wouldn't mind the world knowing on my clearnet browser, so no big deal. I have duckduckgo for the rest of the time primarily so I can avoid personalized results (which Google does by more than just your account history).I use Torbrowser for anything research related, reddit, etc. I use searx.me as my search engine, and sometimes also duckduckgo.I have a slew of emails of which gmail is one. I only use gmail for communications I wouldnt mind the world seeing e.g. work related. I use openmailbox.org or protonmail for anonymous email basically just for password resets, bug trackers, etc. For forum updates is where protonmail is used- I don't want that read so as to avoid being profiled. I use a GPS unit for navigation with maps all downloaded to the unit. I will look up an address in Torbrowser, then punch it into my GPS. It isn't as convenient, but it gives google the middle finger. I have basically cut Google and Facebook completely out of my life. I'm sure each has some data on me, but not anywhere near as much as they have on most people.

The setup is easy, also I dont need to have Dropbox installed in order to work with it (IICR it uses the Dropbox API), and the access to the Dropbox account can be limited to the app folder, or total. Again, that's up to your requirements.

That’s a total security and privacy risk, not for this specific app but for any similar app created with malicious intent. I’m glad Apple rejected it at first as it shows that they take the security of their ecosystem seriously, and I’m even more glad that they gave him an opportunity to present his app and ultimately accept it. IMO people made a way bigger deal out of this than they should’ve, imagine if Apple let any app that hooks that deeply into other apps onto the App Store.

6258	 Incredulous_Toad	 I had usb driver issues as well! It only wanted to half work on one usb port on my laptop, and even that was a struggle. I've sent in, traded in and sold rooted phones before, never had any issues with warranty or anything. I can't imagine they care if it is rooted or about the warranty, as long as the damage is covered.	
6259	 Youknowimtheman	 That is not the same issue.The NSA (and presumably all of the other spy agencies with the capability) are storing away the encrypted traffic of targets now so that when the capability comes along, they have an "encryption way back machine" to break into previously unbreakable traffic and reveal the contents.The NIST competition is already under way and there are a number of Quantum-hard algorithms that have decades of theoretical research behind them. But that will only protect us from traffic generated on that day and moving forward from the beginning of its use.Additionally, the NSA has a literal army of mathematicians and computer scientists that work on secret algorithms for themselves, the other agencies, and the military that are much more robust than what civilians have. They've also likely done a huge amount of research on this already.The "oh shit, everyone needs to be using QR algorithms!" day is still at least a decade away, by then the problem will have already been solved for the vast majority of the public through standards updates.For people/organizations that governments would want to specifically target, your data is already being collected.McEliece is an example of a battle-tested (in theory) QR asymmetric algorithm.

6264	 TheBrainSlug	 Hmm. I was temporarily finding myself repeatedly subject to a Reddit A/B test (a particularly nasty one, requiring login to access Reddit). I switched IPs (via VPN), closed Firefox, started a new private window, and there it was again! Bitched about it in this sub at the time. I don't keep cookies or anything. I was left feeling really confused. No RES here. A new private window would make Reddit "forget" I had recently logged in (changing the A/B test behaviour), but I stayed "opted in" to the A/B test. Other users I talked to were not affected. Found the page describing the A/B test and that's just what I was getting. But how did they know to keep targeting *me*? 	
6265	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Make sure its encrypted before it goes into the cloud or else your data will be scanned from a different angle.Also, if your phone leaves your sight into one of their backrooms, can you ever trust it again? I doubt they do it for everyone, but who knows who is on the "list" and whether that gives them justification to deploy malware etc on your device. We can't be entirely sure they only make copies or image our devices...If money allows, I would buy a device when I get where I'm going (like a prepaid  deal). If not, I'd go without and borrow someone elses phone when I need to make a call.You can say such malware is tin foil territory, but who knows what monsters hide in the darkness; you have to assume the worst nowadays.	
6266	 7YdszFAv	 Make a backup using iTunes on your computer.	
6267	 ManOfCactus	 The benefit is that an attacker can't login to your account if he gets your password. If you have a phone, this is really the best option (after Yubikey) to do 2FA. andOTP can backup the secret used for 2FA so if you lose your phone but gave a backup, you can still access your account.	
6268	 postlapsar	 This is true of all borders, not just the US. A few months ago, there was an article in the press about how border agents seized a cell phone belonging to a NASA engineer that contained important gov documents. I LOLed because the press never mentioned any concerns about this person bringing his NASA documents to a foreign country. The Chilean border agents could have seized it too. I dont take my phone across borders, just a burner with the basics needed to communicate. If it gets taken, no big loss. Same for laptops. I take an old “burner” laptop that gets wiped after each trip.

[Posteo](https://posteo.de/en/blog/new-easy-email-encryption-with-autocrypt-and-openpgp-header) will soon implement this as well.Edit: It's nice that other developers are helping Autocrypt: "...Currently involved are developers from K9/Android, OpenKeyChain/Android, Enigmail, Delta.chat, Mailpile, Bitmask/LEAP, py-autocrypt, pyac and notmuch, as well as people from the NEXTLEAP, enzevalos and panoramix research projects and the ACLU."	
6273	 my-fav-show-canceled	 The only real way to opt out is with an adblocker.  Most opt out procedures require you to enable more tracking than you'll ever get out of.  If I remember correctly the reason that you're having difficulty is that your browser is blocking 3rd party cookies.  You can "accept third-party cookies" so that 124 organizations stop tracking you but thousands more will be able to track you better.This opt out process is a dog and pony show for political gain.  The goal is to make opting out so difficult that no one does it while providing the political capital of being able to say that people can "opt out."It's a trap.edit: reworded for clarity.

6278	 Tib5	 Do you have a smartphone? Also, did you connect that smartphone to your home and wherever this place was?If so, that is likely how Google found out it was you. Google (and plenty of other companies) reads the entire network of your router (including but not limited to MAC and private IP, and no it doesn't matter if your network is Private or Open) if you connect a device to it. In other words, smart devices map your network, and any network they connect to. Their's no way of avoiding that issue, that's 100% guaranteed to work.In theory, you can turn this off by doing the following for each brand. Their maybe more, but not that I'm aware of:* Google = At the end of the router's SSID, add the following "_nomap" (minus quotation, of course).* MicroSoft = Go to [THIS](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/20039/opt-out-of-location-services) page and follow the instructions.* Apple = They don't allow you to "opt-out".* Misc = Some devices include this feature in "Location Services", but..... turning that off doesn't always mean that "feature" is turned of on some brands.So how do you remain private online well, look this over:* Public IP address = Companies can find roughly where someone is by their IP. Though this can be hidden with VPNs, Proxies, and even ISPs implement safeguards to protect against this (big shout out to PlusNet in the UK for that).* Network Mapping = This is what I've talked about above. It's a way for companies to get an even accurate picture of where you are, via WiFi, and even GPS enabled devices. Pretty much anything Smart. Also remember you, don't neseserally need to be the one mapping your network, or someone elses, anyone's smart device can do it. Then if that company has access to his/her's device, and can find a way to link it to you (an example of this is Email, and phone number), it can be done that way instead.* Cookies &amp; Scripts = Pretty much everything I wrote in the original post should stop this.* Using those services, even with doing everything I've mentioned. Remember your information, is being logged, monitored, and likely monetized. You're best bet is not to use those services, while still doing everything I mentioned above.

If the VM is auto-infected when the usb is inserted, then it can use any available VM vulnerabilities to reach the host machine. That can be tough though.	
6282	 FeatheryAsshole	 the USA came pretty far with imprisoning people for minor crimes (e.g. drug possession). it doesn't look like the UK is conducting their state business in a reasonable manner, these days.also, not everyone wants to go into piracy, especially if they have a high danger of steep fines (UK is cracking down on piracy, as well). pornhub et. al. is this popular because right now, it's easy to use and risk-free (legally).

And they support hidden volumes...So, that's one way out, as cloning a phone would not whale someone to access that type of storage space....For now it looks to be the only attempt at something like this, not sure why there is such a lack of plausible deniability software. There are a few countries other than the us where you would really want to do this, because you may go somewhere where you can't get to reliable internet anyway, to just pull something from the cloud.. So it would work for the US also.Standard encryption they can't get into, but if they happen to run into it during a fishing expedition and want to see inside whatever .. It's not going to be as effective as plausible deniable type encryption.Seriously, there needs to be far more... Guessing it's supremely difficult for that sort of thing to be done right.. (perhaps it was even luck that true then vera both happened to be able to get audited)Separate from all that, though legally its a mess.. And we will have to wait for the right lawsuit for clarification on border searches and scope when electronics are involved..The border law is screwy, but if the EFF/etc aren't able to escalate the potential issues of current policy, then it will only become moot(and useless) when big names finally make plausible deniability the standard. I wonder if Google, Microsoft, Linux, etc have thought at doing this... As it's the ultimate security..

6306	 humanmanguy	 Yes, but Google owns the full rights to it all. This means that they have the power to, at any point, decide to stop releasing the source. Or, more likely, they'll just not keep the public repos up to date with the latest features, which means that most people will probably be running a version of the software for which they can't view the source code. Plus, they're most likely going to bundle a bunch of proprietary secret Google code into any released products, meaning that the code that is actually open source will probably not have anywhere near as many features as what's actually being used in the world (which is exactly the case with Android today).And to make things worse, the kernel is released under an MIT license, meaning that it's pretty much guaranteed that any manufacturer releasing a phone with it will *not* release the source code. So no more custom roms, and rooting will likely get much harder if not impossible.For all intents and purposes, the new kernel (and probably OS) is not open source in the traditional sense. The only reason they're releasing the source code is for the benefit of smartphone/device manufacturers, as evidenced by their choice of the MIT license (which is not good for consumers; look at what happened with Intel and Minix).

6309	 Brain_Blasted	 While I wouldn't say that it's no longer open source, I do agree that it has the potential to block all the good bits that come with Android's structure. However, Google could always withhold source code for Android, and they did for one major release. Since Android is Apache licensed rather than GPL,  they could get away with doing that. I would like to see a fully GPL phone OS one day, even if companies don't take to adopting it.

6313	 humanmanguy	 True, but my skepticism comes from the recent history of Android. It was released as open source in good faith to promote rapid adoption. That worked. But today? They don't need to do that. If they suddenly stopped releasing new contributions to AOSP, there would be major backlash. The new thing they're working on, however, isn't Android. It's a different product that they can launch however they want without having to worry about adoption.The operating system on your average phone will be about as "open source" as the Playstation 4's operating system (which is based on BSD).

This phony story was used by the FBI (who were also working with the Clinton campaign) to spy on the Trump campaign and give Clinton the inside scoop when campaigning against Trump. Then the thing they thought would never happen happened and Trump won the election which led to it being exposed.Right now the Democrats are trying to prevent a memo which apparently incriminates the Clinton campaign and the FBI leadership from going public which is why #ReleaseTheMemo is trending.

6364	 inthenameoflew	 Yikes: "Andrew Clement, a computer scientist and expert in surveillance studies, has been mapping the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping activities since before Snowden’s disclosures. He strongly believes the agency would not be restrained in their uses of speaker recognition on U.S. citizens. The agency has often chosen to classify all of the information collected up until the point that a human analyst listens to it or reads it as metadata, he explained. “That’s just a huge loophole,” he said. “It appears that anything they can derive algorithmically from content they would classify simply as metadata.”"I wonder if this would extend to extracting keywords.

6370	 ABaseDePopopopop	 I'd sell it. No way I'm putting a listening device controlled by a third party in my home. Now every time you say something or play a song/movie, you're wondering in mind what Google is going to extract from it. 	
6371	 notatmycompute	 Glad I don't live in the US then	
6372	 Issachar	 Because you answered my Devil's advocate question "why shouldn't rooting void your warranty?".If you think it's reasonable that rooting voids a warranty, then never mind.	
6373	 YumiYumiYumi	 I do understand the reasoning behind 2FA, but I believe that password security is sufficient for my needs.  One doesn't need *perfect* security, they just need *sufficient* security.  There's a cost for every additional measure you put in place, and I don't see sufficient justification to use 2FA for the extra effort required.  Of course, others may have different value propositions, which is fine.Thank you for the explanation nonetheless :)	
6374	 ArmaniDiamonds	 Yeah... That's not gonna happen 	
6375	 maosredbrook	 You'll want to be versed in forensics, and primarily r/AntiForensics. They kill people based on metadata.	
6376	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt;  The space-bar generally makes a distinct soundAll keys make a distinct sound.&gt; so I wonder if that makes it feasible to tell the word-count as well as the length of each word by only hearing the keystrokes.Based on hearing the keystrokes, it is possible to deduce the entire password, not just the spaces. If keyboard acoustic emanation eavesdropping (what this area of surveillance is called) is an actual, serious concern within your threat model, then you need to create keyboard babble tapes: randomized recordings of the sounds of keyboards typing (ideally including the same keyboard model, or even same keyboard that you have) that you play while typing your message. Or try to find a keyboard that is as silent as possible (in other words, definitely not a mechanical keyboard).	
6377	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; So, what scenario do you imagine where someone has a sensitive enough mic nearby to figure out when you hit the spacebar and cannot either use a camera or install a hardware keylogger?It's a very common scenario, unfortunately: if you are doing a voice chat (whether Skype or something encrypted like Signal or Tox), while also typing stuff, an adversary can potentially recover what you have typed during the voice chat session based on the sounds your keyboard made in the background. It's called keyboard acoustic emanation eavesdropping. There is freely available software for this.

6390	 my-fav-show-canceled	 Creepy: Enabling malware vendors to target our vulnerable elderly and young.  Seriously stop enabling assaults on my mother.  That's not personalized advertising. It's targeting the vulnerable for exploitation.  I assure you that those ads are not relevant to anyone on the planet.  Since I've installed an ad blocker on my mom's computer she's not been victimized by fake medicine, fake antivirus, or fake products in general really.If you want to be less creepy stop enabling creeps.Secondly, if you want people to be less creeped out, provide a really good reason for having the "oddly specific data." Spotify, in my experience, is rather poor at suggesting music that I like.  Really.  I have to assemble a playlist myself because despite all the data they collect they still suck at suggesting songs that I like.  It often feels like their only trick is having a very large library of songs.Same for Netflix. Despite me repeatedly telling it what I like and don't like, the "AI" can't make very good suggestions.  I mean, I use it daily and I feed it lots of data yet I had to find out from an external source that the next season of a show I like is on Netflix.  I had to use the search feature to find the show again because for some reason despite everything the AI had decided that it wasn't worth suggesting... WTF?  I binged it, rated it positively, binged second season, but when the third season rolls out... not a peep?But you can tell me that 53 people watched some shitty Christmas show every day for 18 days.  It gets creepy when I get the impression that only humans are looking at the data and not for the sake of offering a better service.  At least tell me that your AI spotted the trend and not some dude who potentially lacks moral restraint (a demonstratively very common human condition).

However I'm unwilling to miss out on some technologies and income opportunities because of a privacy risk.

6444	 AreYouDeaf	 #LIKE THE WAY HE DRAINED THE SWAMP.	
6445	 redcoy	 The amount of privacy one must sacrifice in order to consume media is not as big as it may seem.Take the fingerprinting option for example. Setting `privacy.resistFingerprinting` to `true` *removes* most information about your system and browser from your request headers including but not limited to language, screen size, browser version, operating system, time zone, ...1. All that information can be *modified* by hand, so you do not have to send real data.2. All that information is only used for statistics because it does not give much detail about you as a person. Note that they cannot identify you anyway because of the other settings are working just fine.I received Netflix as a gift from a friend and I actually like the service so I dived into this a little. If you want to send no information at all it is your choice. For myself I decided (reluctantly) that Netflix can use some information about my system in order to protect their content.

Get rid of the lobiests, stop senitors being beholden to big business.Instead he promotes a corporate lackie to every office in the land and if he can't find a corporate lap dog he leaves the position unfilled while the countries protections and even data are swept down the gurgler.	
6453	 gethooge	 Ah yes, "deleted." I'll take their word for it, they seem trustworthy.	
6454	 [deleted]	 Pirating media is the absolute worst for privacy and security.1) There is a pretty big amount of malware found amongst the pirated media;2) when talking about piracy, people are usually reffering to torrents which relly on P2P architecture and P2P is the nightmare of nightmares in terms of privacy; 3) most people don't have a VPN, so ISPs can easily see what they pirate which is an immediate loss of privacy, but even if you do use it, you have a chance of your VPN provider seeing what you're downloading.The only way to even have a chance of maintaining your privacy while consuming media is to buy DVDs and BluRays in store, with cash. How did you come to the idea that the worst way to consume media is THE best way to consume media, I have no idea.	
6455	 ipev	 On Windows, updates are managed by a separate program which scans all your installed Microsoft programs and fetches corresponding updates for them.On Android, updates are managed by the play store.The connections on these and all other programs act as a ping. When you're online, Microsoft knows you're online. As far as the data transmitted is concerned, it could be anybody's guess. Perhaps metadata of all the documents you view, your device identifiers etc.If you use templates, then you'll need to unblock one of the processes that downloads them from the Microsoft servers. Each program will have several processes. Multiple processes will ping the Microsoft servers. So you'll have to identify the redundant ones yourself.Basic firewall/network monitoring tool will suffice.There are no cons.

6478	 stefantalpalaru	 &gt; That's a good thing.No, it's not. They deleted the proof of their illegal surveillance activity so they cannot be prosecuted for it.	
6479	 uoxuho	 &gt; The last legal showdown over the issue may have actually compounded the NSA’s problems. In May 2014, an NSA official known as “Miriam P.” assured the court that the data were safe.&gt; &gt; The NSA is “preserving magnetic/digital tapes of the Internet content intercepted under the [PSP] since the inception of the program,” she wrote, adding that “the NSA has stored these tapes in the offices of its General Counsel.”&gt; &gt; The agency now says, “regrettably,” that the statement “may have been only partially accurate when made.”This demonstrates that the issues we talk about regarding NSA surveillance are not just about the surveillance itself, but are also about democracy and justice generally. A democratic and just society should hold everyone accountable to the law equally, and there should be mechanisms in place to limit the power of any given facet of that society's government.The courts have the purpose of overseeing the functions of the executive. The executive should not be able to escape this important oversight simply by failing to comply with the courts' orders.Even if you are not opposed to the type of surveillance at issue in this particular case, you should still be very troubled by the ability of these classes of people (that is, people that work within the intelligence community or domestic law enforcement) to completely escape responsibility for their actions, or by the ability of these programs and organizations to exist and operate completely independently of any meaningful oversight.	
6480	 Rafficer	 It's better than giving them data unencrypted. But you still need to install their software and you don't know what that's spying on...	
6481	 bitb0y	 Well it's open source, no? Wouldn't that cover that issue?	
6482	 Houston_Here	 Yea the first time I was offered one I looked at the capabilities of the app to read, modify and wipe anything and everything.  No thanks boss man.	
6483	 mikkoseed	 I'm sure they properly put it into Recycle Bin.	
6484	 merger3	 Yes, it's a safe solution. I think some metadata may stay unencrypted, but it's otherwise secure.Encryption works.	
6485	 bitb0y	 I just installed it.. am I missing something, or does it not encrypt the vault names? Or maybe I'm using it incorrectly? Also, I am hoping to replace Boxcryptor with Cryptomater, and with Boxcryptor, you don't create vaults, but instead connect a service to it. For instance, you can go into preferences and connect your Google Drive, Dropbox, etc account to it. Once that's done, it mirrors the entire directory, but only encrypts what you choose to encrypt on a file-by-file/folder-by-folder basis. It seems like with Cryptomater, you would need to essentially create a separate vault to replace each folder that you're trying to encrypt.. 	
6486	 706b30	 Someone accidentally wiped them with a cloth. 	
6487	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 It's basically used to deliver relevant ads. Which basically alters you to buy or view certain things. When you use Google, you're using the Internet through a filter. Whereas when you switch to an open source browser like Firefox or Waterfox. And use a privacy oriented search engine like DuckDuckGo or Startpage, you're viewing the Internet without any filters. It's better to be out of the filter bubble. Also, Google can sell all your information out at any point. That wouldn't be the case if you use the above mentioned alternatives.	
6488	 3756215154895787951	 I suggest self-hosting the server on your localhost. It's really easier than it sounds.Also, it's open source and encrypted. I like it and recommend it.	
6489	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 Thanks for the reply. But could you help me set it up? Absolute newb here.	
6490	 bitb0y	 Also, wouldn't the way this works (by creating virtual, encrypted, pw protected drives) be exactly the way a .sparsebundle in OS X works, except this would require the need for a piece of 3rd party software?	
6491	 Rafficer	 Cryptomator is, yes. But I'm talking about Google Drive. You have to install that software in order to use it with Cryptomator. And you don't know what Google Drive does except for syncing your files.	
6492	 fredanderssen	 So in other words, you're just spit-balling. You're "sure there are exploits" but don't know of any yourself, just as you're sure that MacOS uses a "pin lock." I'm also as sure as you are about exploits in Windoze and Linux, but they haven't been published yet, right along with their "pin lock."

6496	 throwaway1111139991e	 It is end to end encrypted. The only risks are from hacking.	
6497	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 Cool idea, but one possible flaw is the size of the unique ID given in the URL. For example: https://transfer.sh/66nb8/hello.txt This can easily be guessed / enumerated and files meant for private sharing become publicly exposed. What's to stop me writing a script that generates all possible five digit alphanumeric IDs and then seeing what file exists there?	
6498	 bitb0y	 What could they do with encrypted files though?	
6499	 bitb0y	 Interesting. Ty	
6500	 Rafficer	 &gt;#  And you don't know what Google Drive does except for syncing your files.	
6501	 iter_facio	 I guess it all depends on what options they give. My company tells us that we can do one of three things: BYOD, Get a separate phone (which we pay for but they control) and use that, or go without at the risk of, in their words, missing out on better *team cohesion* whatever that means.I chose to go without. I made it clear that my personal time was my own. I took the risk that my team was going to be good with it.Some companies are not so forgiving. I guess you just have to decide if letting the company track you in exchange for being employed is the sword you want to die on, so to speak. It should not be this way, but it is getting worse.	
6502	 bitb0y	 Right, but what _could_ they do? There's nothing they could do with encrypted files that I can think of that should be of concern. Can you think of anything?	
6503	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 &gt; After debate ended in a close cloture vote on Tuesday, the Senate has voted to pass a bill that will renew for another six years one of the NSA’s most controversial practices. The bill, known as the FISA Amendments Reauthorization Act of 2017 or S. 139, provides for an extension of the U.S. government’s practice of collecting the private communications of American citizens when they are communicating with a foreign target. The six-year renewal passed in a 65-34 vote.&gt; Over the course of its long path toward renewal, the bill faced vocal opposition from privacy advocates. Many argue that Section 702 violates the Fourth Amendment’s provision forbidding unreasonable searches and seizures without a warrant. The bill’s supporters contend that it is “one of the U.S. government’s most important counterterrorism and counterintelligence tools” — and Congress appears to agree. Last year, in a rare win for anti-surveillance activists, the NSA announced that it would end the most controversial part of the already very controversial practice  — the one that allowed it to surveil Americans who even mentioned foreign targets (this is known as “about” collection).

Were such decisions made in the political arena, most of us would deem it tyranny. Democracy and majority rule give an aura of legitimacy and decency to acts that would otherwise be deemed tyranny.* ~ [Walter E. Williams](https://www.creators.com/read/walter-williams/11/12/democracy-and-majority-rule-12-11-21)

6515	 MaximusMMIV	 This is a really sensationalist article. Everything it says is true (as far as I can tell, as someone who manages an MDM server for a Fortune 500 company). The real point should be: *decide if it’s worth it to you to* install an MDM profile on your phone. Decide for yourself if you trust your employer enough. It can provide benefits to you as an employee, and it certainly provides benefits to your employer regardless. I’ve worked on (or worked with the people who worked on) MDM technology for two very large, recognizable companies during my career and I can say that the administrators were exclusively concerned with securing organizational data and nothing else.

6520	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Facebook doesn't care about the news, about whether the news is accurate, or about whether the news viewed furthers a person's understanding of a subject- they like every other corporation care about *money.*Plenty of people will think highly of this move, but in reality it will just reinforce and grow echo chambers, and thus ultimately stifle dissenting views. This is basically informational tyranny, and proves that what makes money is not always what is best for society.I think there are plenty of voices out there that would argue such realities. Where are they going to reach a large enough audience to have an impact? Facebook? You can bet since Facebook has the means to control what news people see that they will use it to protect their business (by stifling at least a percentage of anti-facebook articles).

6525	 Longent	 So let me get this straight - even if inbound and outbound connections for an Office program are blocked, the program will continue to update normally - but the functionality of being able to use templates will be broken? I'm not big on templates, so this isn't a huge issue for me. Being able to maintain automatic updates while inbound and outbound connections are blocked was my #1 priority. That being said:&gt; you'll need to unblock one of the processes that downloads them from the Microsoft servers. How do I do this exactly? Does this just mean temporarily disabling the inbound connection block for the Office program in question? 	
6526	 JeffersonsSpirit	 &gt; A democratic and just societyI agree with 99.999999% of your reply- I really do. I carried out 6 decimal places to really drive home that point but....We do not have a democracy. Democracy is a tyranny of the majority. You can't even really have "law" with true 100% democracy. An example of democracy--&gt; you, me, and 8 other people make up a society. Suddenly one of the persons says "I fucking hate JeffersonsSpirit and he needs to die because he makes me sick." Everyone takes a vote except for me (because its about me) and the final tally is 5 for and 4 against. You yourself are against my death protesting with "you may not like him but he's never hurt anyone!" The other 3 people voice their passionate agreement. But hey- democracy has spoken. Someone pulls out a gun and shoots me dead- democracy has been served. It doesnt matter that I or the rest of the minority disliked the idea because democracy is a tyranny of the majority.I know this seems long-winded, and I also happen to *think* that indeed you intended to imply "a constitutional republic with democratically elected leaders," especially when you included "just." Nonetheless I think relying on implication is dangerous. If we keep spouting off about democracy, eventually *we wont care what the minority thinks.* Look at the Facebook news filtering democracy bullshit- its already starting!It is vitally important that we remember democracy is not our governance nor is it ideal. We cannot lose sight of an individual's value, and we cannot lose sight of the fact that what the majority wants is not what matters most- the rule of law that sanctions the civil liberties of each individual is what matters most. Remember: the vast majority of the population doesn't even care about privacy to the extent most of us here do (or they feel apathetic given the complicity of the majority in regards to data gathering corporate and governmental)- with democracy the 4th amendment would be completely dead already. At least with a Constitutional Republic, we have a chance at... something... waking up the masses to such an extent that we can pull the 4th amendment out of its death spiral. Again, I 99.999999% agree with you. I dont want to come off as a nitpicker, nor do I want to dismiss your fantastic reply by focusing on the morsel I don't agree with. I just want to point such language out *because I have seen so much of it lately*- even from presidents and other politicians. We cannot be sold this bill of goods!

6534	 JeffersonsSpirit	 All of the things they would use require infrastructure to support. It really depends on how widescale the rebellion is. If those maintaining the infrastructure they use are part of the rebel cause, its only a matter of time before the rebellion has the upper hand. Not to mention the reality that such a conflict would effectively destroy the relevance of the country, and thats something that those in power of the country would strive to avoid... by not being as tyrannical.I'm not going to make a huge argument for whether American's could win an all-out war with its own government- I happen to think it could, but at a tremendous cost. Even if the reverse is true, the cost would destroy this hypothetically dystopian America and thus destroy the power of the tyrants running it.I agree that information and misinformation are now weapons, but I do not think they are the only weapons. They are the weapons that are used to sway the masses- but a government completely divorced from following the will of the people will not be swayed by the people doing the same. As long as bullies still throw punches on the playground, so too will governments aim to become tyrannical... and giving the bullies more power by stripping our own is not going to help.FWIW, I have not downvoted you- it is a civil discussion (though I am admittedly tardy this round).

The recovery process if you loose your password is to wipe the encrypted data from Mozilla's servers, create new a sync (encrypted with new credentials), and finally update all your devices with the new credentials.If you plan to use sync with Android devices:&gt; Passwords will not sync to Firefox for Android if a Master Password is enabled.

6546	 ciderpunx	 If only lowercase letters and digits are used you get 36^5 ==60466176 possible URLs. Which is pretty enumerable.But don't forget that you'd also have to guess the filename that resided at the URL to be able to look at what was there. That would be infeasible in general, though I bet there are some common filenames that you could try appending to each possible 'token' value (New File.txt, AWSCredentials.properties, etc).What you call a unique id is actually just a random 'token' and not guaranteed unique. It gets generated (at https://github.com/dutchcoders/transfer.sh/blob/d0c7241b3165edf4aab5e87327cbbb73286908b2/server/handlers.go#L205) like this:    token := Encode(10000000 + int64(rand.Intn(1000000000)))I've not looked at the implementation details of how the file gets stored (the code is here: https://github.com/dutchcoders/transfer.sh/blob/d0c7241b3165edf4aab5e87327cbbb73286908b2/server/handlers.go#L276), but it does make me think there could be a name clash if the s.storage.Put doesn't fail on attempting to overwrite a file that exists. Say you try and store a file and there is already a file with that name stored on there; there's a 1 in 60466176 chance that your new file will overwrite the old one. In reality the chances of any 2 files with the same name being stored under the same token is considerably higher (by analogy with the birthday paradox). If it was me doing this, I'd take a hash of the file content (or the first megabyte, say, for large files) to generate the URL "token". That would guarantee uniqueness in the token as well as providing a longer token to make the enumeration infeasible. But the URLs would be harder to type and less pretty, so I guess it'll depend on use case.	
6547	 ChiefCryptoTech	 I've worked in that fucking building and the people in general are alright, but overall that place is evil ! (amazing food court in there though - lol) I'm telling you man, our government does so much fucking shit they're not supposed to while they're locking up some little guy for a joint ! :(I've even been retired over a decade and the tech and abilities they had back then was fucking terrifying. We are all monitored everywhere, all the time - you should pretty much assume (duh). Locking a cell phone to an incoming missile is a piece of cake ! The good news for us is that there's an inherent manpower issue that prevents them from being able to scrutinize EVERYBODY, there's a looooong line of people to go after, so I feel like most of the little fish are going to just keep on swimming.It's ironic that I'm a retired public servant (I'm not saying what I did) because I have the most disgust for our government I can possibly have. I love this country but the VAST majority of the people who are latter climbers without ethics, are supposed to be "representing us" but it's clear to anyone who pays attention that who they're representing is the interests of big corporations and the interest of other countries AT THE EXPENSE OF the regular citizens.I don't even know where I'm going with all this - I just saw the picture of NSA and it gave me a flashback ! lol

6554	 JeffersonsSpirit	 You cannot be sure. You can use extensions like HTTPS Everywhere to try and protect much of your personal data, but you cannot stop them from seeing what domains you visit this way. **EDIT** Any http websites they would be able to see all information exchanged. They would be able to piece together a picture of your computer usage by analyzing what ports are used, what ip addresses are accessed by various applications you use, etc. For all intents and purposes, I would treat this arrangement no different than open wifi at a starbucks- you cannot trust it. You have to hide from this risk, and that means to protect all internet traffic. **END EDIT**To protect all internet traffic, you either need to route *ALL* your internet traffic through Tor, or you need a VPN. Given the speed penalty of Tor (primarily due to latency), I would go with a VPN. A VPN routes all data through a tunnel to the VPN server; a good VPN provider also provides DNS so that your DNS queries will be routed through the tunnel as well.If you use Windows, do research on which VPN providers have clients that don't leak dns requests, regular data, and especially if the VPN server should drop for a time. Windows is horrible here and the number of good clients here is  surprisingly small.If you use Linux, you can absolutely make any VPN provider that works with openvpn 100% leakproof. You use iptables to drop all packets not in the VPN tunnel, or you can use ufw which is an easy-to-use frontend for iptables. The easiest way to use openvpn with linux IMO is to use networkmanager-openvpn, but you can use openvpn standalone and probably a number of other clients.Be advised if you use libvirt on Linux that you need to set your init (systemd, openrc, sysvinit, etc) to load iptables/ufw *after* libvirt is loaded; libvirt loads its own iptables rules on startup that will overwrite any currently loaded ones, and one of these rules would allow a VM to communicate with the net even if a VPN server dropped. An alternative is to use iptables-restore or the ufw equivalent after you get all booted up, but the first way is less of a pain.Again Tor can fill this role, but you are almost going to want to setup a gateway VM (something like Whonix gateway would work), and there will be a performance penalty more significant than a VPN. Not sure how you would do this with Windows honestly. There are also things you should/cannot do with Tor e.g. bittorrent etc.

6556	 FinnishCobweb	 Services where you input personal info should be using TLS which mitigates theft of personal info going accross the network.

The privacy policy informs OnlyOffice does perform telemetry and data collection. How is OnlyOffice's approach different/better than MSword/LibreOffice/Google Docs?The privacy policy clearly informs what is gathered. Personal information is gathered if a user makes an account. If a user remains anonymous some functionality is lost. The privacy policy does not elucidate what functionality is lost if a user remains anonymous.

The same people that Facebook algorithms have successfully "bubbled" and mis-informed for years are the same sterling judges of media literacy who will vet news stories on Facebook going forward?In parallel with your point, I think it's a face-saving (ish) way for Facebook to dodge their responsibilities as a billion-dollar media platform and throw it back in the faces of their victims, saying, "YOU fix it."

Proof of the use of military spying powers to conduct illegal political targeting could be the downfall of these draconian programs, so I say, for the love of God, follow through on your rhetoric.

6598	 thingscouldbeworse	 Hasn't stopped them yet, nor their contemporaries like Tor, which is funded in the same way. Personally I find the patronage model much more viable as other projects that require subscriptions and end up failing when interest fades. There's no way Signal dies out completely with the funding they have, worst case scenario is they scale back their operations to just keep the servers up and cease development.Which itself isn't even that bad of a scenario, considering it's open source and takes community patches.

That's baked in now.In theory https protects, but in practice many banks have staff which set websites to the lowest common denominator ciphers. So you are always less secure than you think. Add the weakness of a phone platform - well, you get the drift.Our national broker can't even send out proper TLS email. Bet yours can't either. So all of us need humility when trusting this stuff. It's always a risk. Especially with phones.

Using iOS as and example, read this https://www.apple.com/business/docs/iOS_Security_Guide.pdfAlso, the majority of Linux distros cant even compete with a windows 10 system by default when it comes to exploit mitigations and other OS level security. 	
6618	 TheBrainSlug	 &gt; compared to, say, desktop linux, android and iOS are much more insecure  That depends on the particular threat you are trying to defend yourself against. iOS and Android have some nice security-by-isolation features, so one piece of malware cannot affect a separate "trusted" app, like your bank app. Some desktop distros can do this (even better -e.g. Qubes) but most do not make any attempt in this direction. Generally speaking, on the desktop just one piece of malware can absolutely fucking rape you.  &gt;simply because hackers actually bother with it  Don't put too much faith in security-by-obscurity, mate. Linux really isn't all that obscure these days anyhow. It's obscure on the desktop, sure, but it's dominant in every other environment.	
6619	 FeatheryAsshole	 You entirely missed the reason I gave for why desktop linux is more secure: No one actually bothers with attacking it. 	
6620	 FeatheryAsshole	 OK. Link me with even one example of malware for desktop linux that one might encounter in the wild.	
6621	 grizzly_intel	 This will absolutey never happen.   They have dirt on all of those lawmakers and/or their families. Jim and Sue Clapper have two kids: A son named Andrew, and a daughter, Jennifer Coakley, an elementary school teacher in Fairfax County, Virginia	
6622	 TheBrainSlug	 Remember that patching works. Known malware I might link to is likely fixed (but there is always a *next* attack).  That said, Gyrfalcon and OutlawCountry are recent examples if CIA malware targeting desktop Linux. Mirai targeted Linux-running IoT devices, but that affected a hell of a lot of devices.   My point is, though, I might live on a quiet street, but I still lock my doors.	
6623	 PM_ME_YOUR_LOGINZ	 is safe	
6624	 FeatheryAsshole	 Those CIA tools sound like you have to be a target of the CIA to be at risk - if you're at that level, you won't run Ubuntu, anyway.As for Mirai, afaik it only worked so well because so many IoT devices didn't even follow the most basic security principles. If you set a half-decent password, use something to block brute-forcing it through SSH and update your device regularly, you're good.

NTT and Level3 give us transit.  GCA puts in some money and helped organize the threat-intel feeds and some of the PR for the announcement.Basically, we don't record IP addresses, because we don't have contracts with the users, so there would be no way to be GDPR compliant, if we did.  Also, then we'd have to worry about data breach, etc.  Since there's no good reason to do it, and a lot of good reasons not to, we do the obvious thing, and don't collect any PII in the first place.Does that answer your question(s)?

There's a small fee attached to each purchase if you fund your masked credit cards via your actual debit/credit card unless you connect your bank account (like you would for Privacy.com):&gt;  Unfortunately, VISA / MasterCard / AMEX and other credit card companies have raised our fees. These are fees which we incur each time we charge your credit card to make a Masked Card. For this reason, we need to cover more of our costs when you use your credit card to buy Masked Cards. If you use a credit card to buy Masked Cards, there will now be a fee of $2 per card for all cards under $100 (the majority of cards made today). In addition, we’ll pass on a charge 1.5% of the card value for cards above $100.&gt; There are two important things to note about the new fees:&gt; * Abine is NOT making money off these fees. We are simply passing along the fees we get charged, so that we may continue to provide you with Masked Cards.&gt; * We have added a beta service option to link your bank account to Blur (similar to Paypal). If you link your bank account, since we don't pay as much in fees, you will be able to continue creating Masked Cards for free as part of your annual subscription price.

6654	 twizmwazin	 HTTPS is already over TLS. Someone snooping in on your traffic can't tell what is being sent, only that it is destined for typical TLS ports (443). Adding HTTP headers does literally nothing except add unnecessary padding.If you wanted to try and guess what the traffic is, your best bet would be to just assume TLS traffic destined to a known DNS-over-TLS server is a DNS request.	
6655	 pingctl	 How does this compare to [DNS over QUIC](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-huitema-quic-dnsoquic-03.html)? I worry that the additional HTTP layer will add unnecessary complexity.Additionally, I don’t understand how one would be able to distinguish TLS traffic from HTTPS traffic. TLS happens in OSI layer 4, HTTPS in OSI layer 5, so shouldn’t the latter be concealed anyway? I can only imagine that the traffic pattern is different.

6665	 Valfourin	 Isn’t this just to find the collective group-think?

My issue is that without checking the breadcrumbs it's impossible to know simply by reading alone if you're on the "opinion" section or the news section. The Mainstream Media feel threatened by people turning their backs to get their news elsewhere.  Their opinions are the only real opinions, everything else is bullshit, apparently.

Keep repeating the process until you can no longer paste text.  The last browser extension you enabled is the one causing the problem.  Check it to see if it has any options for "whitelisting" or disabling it on certain websites.  If so, then exclude it from operating on Twitter and all should be fixed.	
6695	 Eidbi	 Self-hosting video on your site.	
6696	 Eidbi	 Having right blockers, spoofers and disablers still allows to identify you, if you don't have Javascript disabled, as it reveals what kind of extensions you have installed. Not using VPN also allows to track you through your IP. If you use Linux, they may identify you, basing on that as well.Now if you use Tails and Tor, then, yes, indeed. Tor spoofs your OS as Windows 7 (at least it did), so you are way harder to fingerprint. Also all Tor users have the same fingerprint. Tor network prevents identifying you, based on your IP, as your traffic is router through several different IP addresses. Tails gives additional pluses to privacy.	
6697	 pingctl	 For the license, see [DocumentServer](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DocumentServer/blob/master/LICENSE.txt) and [DesktopEditors](https://github.com/ONLYOFFICE/DesktopEditors/blob/master/LICENSE). It’s both GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.	
6698	 Eidbi	 Yes, because Google is able to track you by the means of browser itself. Other than that, it can track you through cookies, your IP, your Google account, your Google searches, through Google Analytics, etc.Simply changing browser won't help. As all those means can be used in other browsers, as well. You can partially stop it by blocking third-party cookies, using extensions like uBlock Origin to block ads and tracking scripts, installing and configuring VPN and not using Google, but it is just a partial solution. And any change you do to your browser makes you more unique.To answer your original question, the only browser which properly prevents fingerprinting is Tor Browser. All Tor users are identified as Windows 7 users, regardless of OS, and if settings are unchanged, then you have the exactly same fingerprint as all other Tor users (who haven't changed settings).

6702	 trnabout	 SDBs are tied to your SSN. If you have one with your regular bank it will be quite easy for someone to locate it. Open one with a small regional bank where you have no other affiliations and it will be very difficult for anyone  to find it.  They very secure and if you are not present to open it then the bank has to drill the lock to get it open. As for storage units, they aren’t super secure but if you rent one, paying cash, there is a very low probability that anyone will find it.

6708	 Methmo	 Google indexes websites from all across the world. Chances are, much of the content this law will prevent Google from indexing is hosted outside of the EU; and it is Google providing the links to EU citizens, not the host.I agree it isn't entirely fair, but I can't think of a more sensible solution.

I wouldn't like negative information about me being blown out of proportion either. And you don't want another company profiting of actively propagating your misfortune. The best and only solution I can think of is better curation of content. Don't censor data. Add a quality rating on it by relevance which filters out the sock puppets trying to prop up importance and only make it accessible by people actually looking for it. That's impossible to do manually with so much content being generated worldwide, so I'm hoping for algorithms that are capable of measuring users' integrity and ability to rate specific subjects and value those ratings higher. Those reputations should then not be traced back to legal identities though. That would skew their honesty.An example would be when something goes viral it becomes more prominent, but still has the quality rating of being 'untrustworthy' or 'misleading'. It's all a bit science fiction right now. But we'll get there. 	
6712	 Methmo	 That isn't just "science fiction", but also entirely reliant on the goodwill of search engines.

6714	 letsreticulate	 Agreed. Even Plato saw this coming and this is why he was not a fan of democracy.Not to mention the raw reality that a good solid percentage of your populous will be, by statistics alone, too incompetent or stupid to make sage decisions about stuff they have not taken the time to learn or much less understand.Case in point: Bush Jr., Trump, and the fact that we live in a world where people actually thought Sarah Palin was a viable candidate.

Either one of those companies can correlate your mom's purchases with you easily.The only other thing to consider is [NFC tags](https://electronics.howstuffworks.com/nfc-tag.htm).

This data can be used to correlate items on a [map](https://www.mapyourtag.com/documentation#9) for logistics and advertising purposes.You should make sure to run a custom ROM capable of [blocking ads](https://adaway.org/), and never allow bluetooth, NFC, or wifi to be on unless absolutely essential.If using iOS, you are less secure, but at least can [opt-out of interest based ads](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202074), and use crappy non-free 'psuedo privacy' browsers like SnowHaze, which in theory are better than Safari.	
6724	 BRJNJNQJDPSMYYY	 You'll have to use IMAP on the devices, and POP3 on a trusted computer. POP3 allows direct downloading of messages and removing them from the server, whereas IMAP is only "viewing them" on the server in layman's terms.If your concern is privacy, you will never want to include your *personal* e-mail account on a work iPad Pro.

6748	 skidmark-steve	 Part of me feels like completely filling my phone with photos of my manhood and middle finger before crossing a boarder, by capturing videos and then using ffmpeg to split the frames into individual images. If they want to violate my civil rights, they can enjoy spending hours sifting through hundreds of thousands of HD photos of my penis and middle finger taken from different angles.Correct me if I'm wrong, but I would be well within my rights to do the above.

It's unclear specifically what they're talking about but some VoIP data probably needs to be recorded in order for users to be able to connect to each other.

6757	 PrivacyRabbit	 Discord's privacy policy has always been less than ideal, but you need to remember that this is not a privacy aware service, it isn't open source, and protecting user's privacy is not it's main priority, it is a **free** voice chat service that provides, fast, secure, and good quality communication. It's a question of reasonable means. Discord are a business, rather than a not for profit organisation. 	
6758	 AlpacaKid	 I'm not so bothered by police requests, it's not part of my threat model. Yes you are right, it's not so clear what that actually means huh. I might contact the Discord team to see if they could elaborate on that part.	
6759	 XTXm1x6qg7TM	 You are right, it is something to be concerned about but it could be a 100% innocent thing. From what I heard Discord Devs are pretty good with communicating with people so that'd probably be your best bet.

6770	 Elronnd	 &gt; Someone snooping in on your traffic can't tell what is being sent, only that it is destined for typical TLS ports (443)Not necessarily.  In theory, our encryption is perfect and prevents this.  In practice, however, the encryption is often flawed and can leak headers in which case by having http headers we look like http, while if we don't and our headers leak, a bad actor will know we're using dns-over-tls.

6775	 OnlyHeStandsThere	 ISPs always log data about their users. If someone commits a crime and is investigated, their logged data can be used against them in court. If ISPs just deleted their logs, they wouldn't be able to comply with legal requests for their customer's data. So they're legally required to keep those logs. These copyright trolls typically buy the rights to things that are commonly pirated, like music, video games, or popular TV shows. Because of the way P2P file sharing works, it's easy for them to see how many unique IP addresses are pirating these things even if they don't know who those people are. Then they wait until they're sure a large amount of people have pirated them and issue a legal process to ISPs demanding the personal details behind the IP addresses who have been file sharing so they can issue their demands for repayment. Typically ISPs aren't allowed to tell people the personal details behind IP addresses, but they can be compelled to if there's evidence those IP addresses have committed a crime. That's why you hear about criminals having their internet history searched during their trials: if you're a criminal, and you used the internet to assist in your crimes, your internet history can be used against you.  Pirating is a crime, so if the copyright trolls have evidence that certain IP addresses are doing it they can compel ISPs to disclose personal information about those IP addresses. But the trolls don't want to do this every single time someone pirates something, they'd literally be suing ISPs hundreds or thousands of times every single day and would pay more in legal fees than they could hope to recover. Instead, they watch torrent services being used to share their copyrighted material and log all of the IP addresses involved. Then they sue the ISP to reveal data on every single IP address at once. If that succeeds, they'll send their demand letters in lieu of suing all of those people. People who refuse their demands get sued individually, and that's the last resort because they'd rather have you concede to their demands than pay to sue you. TL;DR:  Copyright trolls can't sue pirates directly because they know IP addresses, not personal details. ISPs can match IP addresses to personal details, but they won't unless there's evidence of crime. So the trolls gather evidence, sue the ISP for details, and then potentially start lawsuits with individual pirates.

6795	 Eidbi	 Yes, Windows 7 changed it model. Now it pushes many updates at once, so you can't cherry-pick updates, as we did earlier. It also added telemetry stuff before that. While these updates still CAN be removed, nothing much can be done with newer updates.That all being said Windows 7 still has an advantage of not being built as an OS for mass surveillance. User still has control over it. Not so much for Win 10.	
6796	 xgwujrep	 If more US citizens resisted border searches...it would eventually spill over to foreign nationals. Imagine the lawsuits for all those lost/stolen phones. We're talking real money.Until it starts to hurt - those searches will continue.

6798	 merger3	 It's been known for a while that Discord is collecting a lot of data about its users.

I simply have to use it for certain, mostly community based, things.If you aren't using Discord already try to use open source and privacy friendly alternatives. If you're like me and already on it, don't have private conversations. 	
6799	 notcaffeinefree	 They can't deny a US citizen from entering. But they can hold them for hours and when they are allowed to leave the phone might not be given back.	
6800	 merger3	 Laptop cameras are notoriously insecure, and there are instances of companies activating it and use machine recognition to record data about you. It's also a target for hackers who can learn a lot from accessing a webcam. On top of that, it's long been suspected (I don't know if it's been confirmed and don't to want spread misinformation) that the government uses then to monitor citizens. Hence the tape over them (famously, Mark Zuckerberg has his laptop webcam taped over).I imagine the OP is extending this concern to his smartphone, although he may be talking about a laptop.

6809	 MisterTheCookiePear	 Great, so not only MS will be getting your data, you can't even guarantee who did what to the code you're running. 	
6810	 Eidbi	 What exactly? Windows 10 LTSB is Windows 10 Enterprise with long-term security updates and none of feature ones. It doesn't have Edge, Cortana, App store, yet it has group policy which **lets** you disable more of telemetry. The point is that you **can** disable more of telemetry in Win10 Enterprise LTSB, but it doesn't mean that it has less. You may read more about it here - https://www.howtogeek.com/273824/windows-10-without-the-cruft-windows-10-ltsb-explained/But be aware, that Enterprise still phones home - https://winaero.com/blog/regardless-privacy-settings-windows-10-creators-update-phones-home/ The one mentioned here is not LTSB, though.	
6811	 MaximumCrumpet	 &gt;How safe is LTE for mobile banking?Assuming the bank uses a sensible encryption protocol, the information will be encrypted before leaving your device.  Eavesdroppers over *any* transmission medium (including LTE) couldn't see the information you're exchanging.	
6812	 Eidbi	 Change link to hooktube, please.	
6813	 ctesibius	 It's pretty good. As /u/1NzG8vM4QEgweFXTFxom says, the main security is from the encryption layer which your app or browser puts on top of LTE - often referred to as SSL, although that's an older protocol and TLS is used now. However in addition to that, LTE is pretty secure itself. Unlike the old GSM protocol, LTE ensures that you are talking to the right network (GSM just made sure that the network is talking to the right SIM, but it was fairly easy to fake the network). There is encryption over the radio interface. Your traffic is in the clear in the mobile phone core network (the wired part), which means that the mobile phone company and the state can intercept it, but no-one else - and of course the TLS encryption on top of that should protect against them.This does not make you completely safe but I would say that mobile banking over LTE is slightly safer than mobile banking over fixed connections. The main remaining threats are the handset (this is a serious problem with some Chinese-made handsets which have been found to have spyware) and the bank's own security for its servers.	
6814	 FeatheryAsshole	 &gt; When you are out in public you HAVE NO EXPECTATION of privacyidk, one has to draw the line somewhere, and I think having your every move stored in some database is way over that line.That said, I wouldn't wear sunglasses everywhere, either.	
6815	 Eidbi	 You can download the official version from Microsoft own site. And then use an open-source activator for it. Not that I am paranoid about piracy versions of OS. I trust pirates way more than Microsoft.	
6816	 Eidbi	 They show you ads, adjust services for you, you are happy with their services, you are viewing their ads, they get money.	
6817	 Eidbi	 Not much to choose. I hope that Palemoon doesn't have Safe Browsing. Other than that only Tor fits the bill, I guess. Firefox has Safe Browsing, Google Analytics through Iframe on Get Addons page and uses Google as default search engine. Others are mostly Chromium forks.

6822	 Eidbi	 &gt;My point is, anyone can say it still has telemetry.Is there any official source, that says otherwise? The point is Windows 10 Enterprise is Home with more features, not with less. Windows 10 LTSB is Enterprise with less features, but it does not affect telemetry, besides Cortana and App Store.I run Win10Privacy and O&amp;O ShutUp immediately after installing LTSB. Most of tracking features, which can be disabled there, were enabled. During installing Win10 LTSB, I disabled Privacy related features, which were offered to me. They were all enabled by default. I don't know what else prove you need.

6826	 brennanfee	 &gt; idk, one has to draw the line somewhereOf course.  But out in public isn't the place.  Likewise, when going onto someone else's property you have no expectation of privacy (outside their restrooms at any rate).Still, the mechanism does matter.  If you are walking down a public street they have every right to use technology to track you (like cameras and microphones).  It is no different than them interviewing witnesses on the street and them reporting that, yes, they saw you walking down that street and 1:30 in the afternoon.  It's just a different mechanism using modern technology.  However, they do NOT have the right to use your cell phone as that mechanism WITHOUT a warrant.  The distinctions are small but they matter.Whether the government should be able to store, for how long, and whether they should be able to use such data indiscriminately and without a warrant are all different matters and worthy of discussion and debate.  The fact is that with our new digital world we have yet to tease out what should be possible with or without a warrants.  Warrants are the primary mechanism that (are supposed to) prevent misuses and use of such data for personal or political reasons.  For instance, a politician or the police tracking people they disagree with is wrong - regardless of what they are using to do that tracking.  But them having better tools to track those with a probable cause of **having** committed a crime is a good thing (notice I said having committed, not potentially to commit - no "pre-cog" for us!).

Who knows where else there are hiding cameras and mics in your home without your knowledge simply because whatever agency or entity wants to keep tabs on you and listening to every single one of your conversations because of their suspicions. Suddenly wanting privacy becomes a cause for spying on regular people, that is why it’s my opinion that eventually, people everywhere will stop trusting all technology. Won’t happen overnight, may take decades but it seems like this kind of future is coming closer.

Then they approach the owner of the IP address and say that they will amend the complaint to replace Doe #3 with the owner's name. And because the copyrighted material is usually porn, the owner settles before the complaint is amended.

6876	 redditor_1234	 I recommend reading the comment that Moxie Marlinspike wrote in response to that blog post on Hacker News when it was first published: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12883410Also, some parts of it are now outdated:&gt;Lack of federationIn his comment, Moxie said:&gt;I've tried to write about why I don't feel like this is going to be a part of our future here: https://whispersystems.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/&gt;However, I would love it if someone proved me wrong. The Signal clients and server already support federation, so there shouldn't be any technical hurdles stopping the people who are really into federation from using our software to start their own federated network that demonstrates the viability of their ideas.&gt;If anyone needs help doing that, let me know. I'd be happy to help.There is now a Signal fork with the specific aim of building a network of federated, independent servers: https://github.com/CableIM&gt;Dependency on Google Cloud MessagingIn his comment, Moxie said:&gt;To clarify this for casual readers, no data at all is transmitted over GCM. GCM is only used as a push event to tell the Signal Android client to wake up and connect to the Signal server to retrieve messages from the queue if the app isn't in the foreground.&gt;This is pretty fundamentally just how Android works. However, people who want to use Google's OS without any Google services flash custom ROMs onto their devices that are missing this dependency.&gt;I have said many times that I have no problem with supporting these custom ROMs. But I would like someone from that community to submit the PR: "I would consider a clean, well written, and well tested PR for websocket-only support in Signal. I expect it to have high battery consumption and an unreliable user experience, but would be fine with it if it comes with a warning and only runs in the absence of play services."&gt;Nobody has done it.In the end, Moxie ended up [implementing Signal’s support for WebSockets himself](https://github.com/WhisperSystems/Signal-Android/commit/1669731329bcc32c84e33035a67a2fc22444c24b). Signal has not been dependent on Google Play Services for nearly a year now. You can install the Signal Android APK directly from the official website and it will automatically fall back on a WebSocket connection if you register on a device that does not include Google Play Services (or OpenGApps or microG):* https://signal.org/android/apk/&gt;Your contact list is not privateIn his comment, Moxie said:&gt;First, on Android 6+ you can just disable the contacts permission and everything works (although you obviously won't see your contact names).&gt;However, we also spend a lot of time thinking about this class of problems, as well as metadata in general. Right now things are playing out alright for one specific class of attack:&gt;https://whispersystems.org/bigbrother/eastern-virginia-grand-jury/&gt;We'd obviously like to do even better. The nice thing about having a centralized service is that we can eventually take steps in this direction. People seem to equate federation with meta-data hiding for reasons I've never totally understood, but I think serious metadata protection is going to require new protocols and new techniques, so we're much more likely to see major progress in centralized rather than distributed environments (in the same way that Signal Protocol is now on over two billion devices, but we're unlikely to ever see even basic large scale email end to end encryption).They are now working on this: https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/&gt;The RedPhone server is not open-sourceSignal hasn’t used any RedPhone related code since they finished transitioning the entire calling system from RedPhone to WebRTC:* https://signal.org/blog/signal-video-calls-beta/* https://signal.org/blog/signal-video-calls/Edit: Expanded on the GCM part.

6878	 uoxuho	 I agree with /u/PatCRafferty. You could also try /r/legaladvice for general help about that sort of thing, though you seem to have a good idea of what you need to do in order to built up a case of this person.As part of your regular defense against this person, have you made it publicly known that the fake accounts are fake? It may be worthwhile for you to have a public statement on Facebook or Twitter or whatever you use, where you say "My name is so-and-so. You can find me on Facebook here, or you can find me on Twitter over there, but nowhere else; any other account claiming to be me is a fake." You can also start to tell your network of closest friends the whole story, so that they know to be vigilant online and can help you protect yourself and basically keep watch over how the imposter may be interacting with others.As for how to actually "catch" this person or collect evidence against them... that is probably very difficult. As has been mentioned, your best bet in the short term is the abuse team of the social media sites in question. As for long term, if you get an attorney and go before a judge to prove criminal stalking/harassment/impersonation, you might be able to subpoena a social media site to gather information about the person posing as you, such as IP address. If you have the resources, a private investigator may be worthwhile.Also, do you feel that you have sufficient resources to keep them from contacting you directly or trying to compromise your online accounts? That is something that /r/privacy is probably better at. We can certainly offer advice on the most secure ways to, for example, delete all of your existing accounts, create new ones, and have your security settings set up so that your new email address, phone number, etc. are unlikely to become known to this person. Feel free to ask about that sort of stuff if you'd like, though I understand that's not really the meat of what you're asking here.I hope that helps.I'm sorry this is happening to you. You seem like you're very logical about the situation and are being very strong. It looks like you're doing everything right, so keep it up, and good luck.	
6879	 billwoodcock	 I didn't actually see any questions in that, but I'll address the factual inaccuracies.You say: "Quad9's parent organization is partnered with multiple police agencies."That's false.  Quad9's parent organization has exactly three partnerships.  They're with PCH, IBM, and GCA.  None of which are police agencies.You say: "...partnered with multiple ... Telecom companies (including Verizon)" The way you've worded it renders your statement false, but there's a grain of truth there.  Several hundred telecom companies support Quad9, including Verizon, although Verizon specifically is a minor donor.  The largest donor, NTT, is the Japanese national phone company.  It is accurate to refer to them as "donors" rather than "partners," since they're making donations to support a not-for-profit, and they are not engaged in any form of partnership.  If you ask either us or them whether they're "partners," the answer would be "no."  Donations are unidirectional, there's no quid-pro-quo.  But we're very grateful for their support.You say: "They also log geolocation data from their users with their DNS queries. Unless you have multiple users of Quad9 in your area, they can identify you."I guess hypothetically that would be true in some very sparsely-populated alternate universe, but you imply that there are geolocation buckets that don't have multiple users in them, which is very, very far from the truth.  The geolocation buckets are at the national level.  I don't know of any countries that don't have at least hundreds of users, many have millions of users.  Again, it wouldn't be possible to be GDPR compliant if PII could be inferred from the aggregate data.Again, if anyone has any actual questions, I'm happy to answer them.

6881	 brennanfee	 &gt; The issue with all that is that it is very, very hard to prevent misuse when the data is already up for grabs.Agreed, but we could try.  This is what warrants are for, as I said.	
6882	 brennanfee	 &gt; If you give away 99% of your privacy because of public space argument, what's there to the debate? You must spend a LOT more time in public than I do.  I would say for me it is maybe 20% of my time tops.  But hey, we each live our own lives I guess.&gt; If they have the right to get the data, why wouldn't they have to right to use it?Because purpose and intent matter.  Especially within the law.&gt; And what's going to stop them?Those laws things I keep mentioning.	
6883	 FeatheryAsshole	 Do corporations even need warrants? You're always agreeing implicitly to their shenanigans just by visiting their site or store, and if you don't want that, your options become so limited that wearing sunglasses in public starts looking like one of the better solutions.	
6884	 brennanfee	 &gt; If all of the so called public space is surveillance all the time, there is nothing left.Lots of places.  Your home.  Your neighborhs home.  Your office.  The private store down the road.  Actually quite a lot of our "space" out there is private property and the government needs a warrant to extract information from them.  [Well, they are supposed to need a warrant but the 4th amendment was eviscerated by the so-called "Patriot Act"; perhaps the most ironically named piece of legislation in history.]Public means literaly public square... as in roads, sidewalks, and any public lands/buildings.  All private property is just that private.  Now, the owners of said property can film you but the government would (should) need a warrant or their compliance to obtain that footage.	
6885	 brennanfee	 &gt; Do corporations even need warrants?We aren't talking about corporations... we're talking about governments.&gt; You're always agreeing implicitly to their shenanigans just by visiting their site or storeYes, it's called private property.  They are allowed to do anything UNDER THE LAW that they wish.  Are you saying that we should make it illegal for them to film their customers?  What about robberies?  Employee theft?  Customer shoplifting? etc, etc.&gt; your options become so limited that wearing sunglasses in public starts looking like one of the better solutions.Now you are reaching tinfoil-hat territory.  Local shops and stores, even mass chains don't have sophisticated facial recognition systems.  They merely record and have the ability to play back when/if there is an incident.  They usually don't even retain longer than 90 days.To my knowledge, the only private locations that have facial rec (like governments can/do) are Casino's.  They us it to track and identify players who have been caught cheating.

Don't redefine the conversation according to your own whims.&gt; Are you saying that we should make it illegal for them to film their customers? What about robberies? Employee theft? Customer shoplifting? etc, etc.It should be illegal to 1. retain footage for longer than a certain time (I'd say 90 days is too long)2. use it to track customers who did not commit crimes3. track employees outside of what is absolutely necessary to prevent theft and fraud.&gt;  Local shops and stores, even mass chains don't have sophisticated facial recognition systems.As long as the footage (+ other datapoints like payment information, rebate cards and whatnot) exists, facial recognition tech can be applied to it - maybe in a few years when it's more readily available, or simply by someone else.The whole deal is a bit like weapon control - sure, not everyone will use a weapon to go on a murder spree, but maybe not everyone should be allowed to carry rocket launchers everywhere, all the time. 	
6890	 brennanfee	 &gt; OP talked about corporations, and so did I. Don't redefine the conversation according to your own whims.But "shops" don't have facial recognition.

We need to place limits on that use, as I have said above, I don't disagree.  But absent a law saying what they can and can not do on their property they are free to do what they want with their property and those whom they invite on it.&gt; The whole deal is a bit like weapon control - sure, not everyone will use a weapon to go on a murder spree, but maybe not everyone should be allowed to carry rocket launchers everywhere, all the time.Exactly... which is why we need to talk about laws and what should or should not be allowed to do with certain data.  Just as we need to be talking about what laws make sense with respect to guns.	
6891	 iReallyHateSoup	 Unfortunately its not possible. If you want to send sensitive data through phones, the text option in snapchat is the best option. Well, Wickr is actually the best option, however if youd rather not have to explain why you have an encrypted messaging service downloaded on your phone, then Snapchat is the answer. 	
6892	 FeatheryAsshole	 &gt; And even if they did whom exactly would they be looking for?Those people who pay Google et. al. for your online history? I'm sure they'd pay for this information, as well.&gt; Except, you don't know until after they do so and the footage becomes the evidence.You can generally identify criminal behavior (theft, robbery etc.) without identifying the actors first - finding that out comes after, or so it has been traditionally, since it required a fair bit of effort.You're right, we need to push for laws - but in the meantime, people need to protect themselves. Sunglasses (and/or face masks if you're Asian) are the street's NoScript - just as conspicuous, but also just as legal.

Profiling is notoriously incorrect.&gt; Sunglasses (and/or face masks if you're Asian) are the street's NoScript - just as conspicuous, but also just as legal.I still say you guys are in tinfoil-hat territory here.  But hey, live how you want.  As long as we agree that we need to push for more laws (regulations) on these issues.	
6895	 Chateeleon	 US Border agents are given wide permission to search items at the border, with the idea security outweighs privacy at points of entry.  However, they are barred from unreasonable search, which is entirely subjective at the border.	
6896	 FeatheryAsshole	 &gt;What information... that I walked into a store?Don't knock it. It might not be that useful as the only datapoint, but if one gathers this data they can create a pretty complete profile of your life - purchasing habits, biorhythm, job etc. Great stuff for targeted advertising, or revising your credit score. That's pretty much what they're doing with the data they get from tracking people online, as well.&gt; Sci fi aside, no... you can only speculate. Profiling is notoriously incorrect.I'm not talking about PREDICTING crime. The general workflow right now (assuming they're not using advanced tech) is to watch a store (CCTV or in person) -&gt; see theft -&gt; identify the thief. &gt; I still say you guys are in tinfoil-hat territory here.I mean, you're not wrong, this is quite extreme. Personally, I don't even use the more inconvenient measures (NoScript, TOR etc) to prevent online tracking. But I do see the merit in trying to prevent tracking in the streets.	
6897	 brennanfee	 &gt; Great stuff for targeted advertising,I don't get any advertising, let alone targeted advertising.  Besides, I'm the type of consumer that advertising to me makes me LESS likely to buy your product not more likely.&gt; is to watch a store (video or in person) -&gt; see theft -&gt; identify the thiefWhich is perfectly fine right?  I thought we agreed they had a right to protect themselves from thieves.&gt; Personally, I don't even use the more inconvenient measures (NoScript, TOR etc) to prevent online tracking.All you need is a good firewall and either DNS redirection or a DNS proxy.  It isn't hard and doesn't require much technical skill.I'll tell you the same thing I tell my clients when the subject of security comes up.  Who are you trying to protect yourself from?  If you say your neighbor that's one thing; you say some corporation that's another; you say governments and that's a whole different ball-of-wax.  It all comes down to what your goal is.	
6898	 skidmark-steve	 You could change the password on the phone to something that isn't used elsewhere ahead of time (face it, we all do that).This way, you could give them the password, but that password wouldn't work for anything else other than the phone.	
6899	 stem4lyfe	 Thank you!!!	
6900	 foxtrotgulf	 I agree with you that you cannot have 100% privacy on a planet that you share with other humans. Inevitably you will have to make tradeoffs. But this doesn't mean that you should stop caring about your privacy. Even though the situation may seem hopeless, you still have a lot to lose. Not everything about you is known to all people. Sure state actors could turn your phone into a surveillance device, but that doesn't mean that you should then setup a public livestream of a camera in your house for all to see because it is easier or more convenient.	
6901	 FeatheryAsshole	 &gt; I don't get any advertising, let alone targeted advertising. Besides, I'm the type of consumer that advertising to me makes me LESS likely to buy your product not more likely.Sure, but you certainly aren't immune to credit scores, insurance premiums and the like. It seems some shops are even setting prices according to who you are, occasionally - i.e., the more money you seem to have, the more expensive the goods are.&gt; Which is perfectly fine right? I thought we agreed they had a right to protect themselves from thieves.Yes, that's fine. But I wouldn't be so sure that they aren't doing far more than that, these days. Organizations, both private and governmental, are typically very far ahead of legislation when it comes to technology.	
6902	 PatCRafferty	 [Your FAQ states you log down to the city level](https://quad9.net/#/faq#how-does-quad9-ensure-my-privacy). Maybe we're talking about different things?By parent organizations I was talking about the founding organizations on your [about page](https://quad9.net/#/about). More specifically I was referring to GCA. The partners, it uses the phrase community partners on their website, includes the stuff I mentioned before.I understand your reasoning with Verizon not being quid-pro-quo, and I back you on that.You may not be directly supporting police agencies, but you are centralizing DNS queries, which means less places to have to search. You wouldn't be intentionally doing that so I understand your perspective on that.I'm also going to mention [this thread](https://web.archive.org/web/20171226163304/https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7lwt6l/psa_please_stop_using_quad9_9999_dont_make_the/), as it talks about the same topic.Correct me on any of this if I'm wrong.	
6903	 brennanfee	 &gt; Sure, but you certainly aren't immune to credit scoresNo.  But the laws around what effect credit score I'm comfortable with.  They all center on credit worthiness and just any old company can't manipulate that (the clearing houses are the only ones that set those).  [In your last post you seemed to indicate to the contrary and I let it pass because I wasn't sure what you were trying to imply.]&gt; occasionally - i.e., the more money you seem to have, the more expensive the goods are.I'm not aware of any single instance of this.  Do you have some examples or some documentation?&gt; But I wouldn't be so sure that they aren't doing far more than that, these days.Again, that's fair.  Absent laws they, theoretically, are allowed to do anything and we all know that we can't trust people doing what is "right" or "ethical" any more.  We have to spell out every tiny minute detail.  Honestly, in the past there were just some things you could expect that people wouldn't do... even if they organized themselves into a corporation.	
6904	 Disclandr	 Thats nothing, check out mylife.com Just look at how much dirt they have on you.  Also usphonebook.com  put your cell phone in there and just watch how much they know about you.  	
6905	 brennanfee	 No, they can't.  They may be authorized to, but that is different than being able to.	
6906	 Disclandr	 Easiest thing would be to contact the suspected stalker directly.  Sounds like some unresolved issues is what is motivating the creep.  Maybe if you called the guy and talked you could get the issue out into the open.  And after that the stalker would no longer have a reason to stalk you.  Sounds like you broke up with some dude and never explained the reason for the break-up.  That will certainly motivate a stalker.  The fact is that we owe it to our partners to explain why we are breaking up with them and to tell them what they did wrong to displease us.    	
6907	 Disclandr	 Not to sound dark but alot of women have been murdered just because they stopped answering the phone for some guy and never told him WHY they are breaking up with him.  In this case its best to just be honest and tell the dude what he did wrong and why you dumped him.  Truth will set you free and silence will get you killed	
6908	 FinnishCobweb	 This depends on how much of a treat you perceive google to be. Trying to protect yourself from tracking using the browser will only get you so far. I recommend a solution similar to the below:-Multiple low powered devices (Rasberry pi) running a minimal linux Distro with each being dedicated for a specific use-Install Nomachine on them and your PC-Install a VPN (Most providers allow up to 5 simultaneous connections)With this setup, each device will be tracked base on how it is used.	
6909	 RevisionCuda	 Noise is also a fork of signal that's available on fdroid if you add the repo	
6910	 Elronnd	 encrypted.google.com is no different from google.com (there used to be a difference).  It's very bad because they still have your ip address and likely some fingerprinting so they can correlate your searches.  Try startpage, duckduckgo, or something like that.	
6911	 Dazurean	 Downside is, have to pay. 	
6912	 Dazurean	 My cell phone probably doesn’t have much on me as it does the previous owner of the number.  I get constant calls for said person from collections agencies. 	
6913	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
6914	 Disclandr	 Nevertheless,I advise you to plug that number into usphonebook.com and also other numbers of close friends and family.  I found in my case that even though my information is pretty clean and anonymous that the cell of my brother, sister and Mom all referenced back to me WITH MY FREAKING FULL NAME ON THAT WEBSITE.  Scared the bageeperz out of me.  Especially my sister who is in the habit of "checking in" to social media everywhere she goes even to the supermarket or "Lynda has check in to Starbucks on 84th Street". And because of her fat blabbermouth and tagging me on FaceBook and stuff I am now exposed and facebook has pictures of my fucking FACE and scanned into their facial recognition database that is available to the government on request.

6917	 AlfredoOf98	 I've read in another sub that there were some sites with bad reputation offering downloads of Signal and other IM apps, these downloads are hosted on these sites and are compiled with some malware.The sites had some how persuaded users to download from them rather than from the official source, and hence many people got compromised security....	
6918	 AlfredoOf98	 I still don't understand why the firewall didn't block it.. why?	
6919	 brennanfee	 That's online.  I was speaking about in a store.  If I walk in and they take my picture I'm unaware of any instance where the gallon of milk I pick up will be a different price.[And for the record I believe it should be made illegal online as well.  But I digress.]

6921	 Gibbonian	 Interesting, thanks for posting. I’ll be checking into this as well.	
6922	 Disclandr	 Is it such a bad thing to keep the outdoors under surveillance?  We could solve all the crimes of muggings, theft and rapes.  I would like to see those 3 things go away if it meant all of outdoors is under surveillance.  	
6923	 precociousapprentice	 They’ve said that it might not retain compatibility with standard Android as the toolchain that’s used for Copperhead continues to be hardened. The base APK found on the Signal website can update, so it’s probably the better bet unless you’re already on Copperhead.	
6924	 sgitkene	 Obtaining the personal details of everyone who had this IP address in a certain period because someone maybe used it for torrenting isn't. Sending a scare mail to everyone's address found this way isn't.	
6925	 wrexthor	 The only reason fdroid should be trusted more than android store is the much smaller amount of users. I'm not familiar with the submission process for fdroid but I doubt it's that much better than Android store. 	
6926	 billwoodcock	 Okay, that helps, I can see how you'd have come to some of those conclusions.Part of what you're seeing is the fact that this is a volunteer effort that's very short on people.  There's a huge amount of work that we still need to get done, and we've been focusing on the critical parts first.  When I said "GCA put in some of the PR for the announcement," that included the web site.  Including the FAQ.  We now have someone internal to the project working on web site content, and all of the feedback we've been getting is helping us prioritize what needs to be on the web site.  So, you're right that the FAQ says that, but in fact, no geolocation has been implemented yet as of when I'm writing this, and in and when we get around to it, I don't think any of us are imagining that it'll be anything finer-grained than country-level.The parent organization of Quad9 is "CleanerDNS, Inc.," which is a California 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation.  Quad9 is a registered d.b.a. of CleanerDNS, Inc.  CleanerDNS, Inc. does not currently have any other projects besides Quad9.  The corporate documents, audit documents, etc., will all be posted to the web site, as we find time to turn our attention from the DNS operational stuff to more ancillary stuff.  The board of directors of CleanerDNS is appointed by the board of directors of Packet Clearing House.  Quad9's infrastructure is supplied by Packet Clearing House, in the sense that Quad9 consists of a lot of VMs running on PCH servers, behind PCH routers, back-to-back with PCH authoritative servers.  PCH's major donors can be seen here: https://www.pch.net/about/sponsors. More or less, the ones above the line donate more than 10% of the budget, those below the line, between 1% and 10%.  Collectively, the thirty governments referenced there contribute less than 1% of PCH's budget.  And, whatever the sources of GCA's funding (which isn't anything I can speak to), GCA contributes less than 1% of Quad9's budget.  Though it's cash, and cash is invaluable, because it pays salaries and health insurance and payroll taxes.  So we're very grateful for it.  But I think it's disproportionate to focus exclusively on the _indirect_ source of less than 1% of the funding.  Indirectly, governments pay for nearly everything.  It doesn't seem a useful differentiator.Without question, any large Internet operation is subject to the law in every country where it operates.  One of Quad9's principle goals is to protect users from lawlessness which makes their use of the Internet unsafe.  We would be hypocritical if we failed to abide by the law, ourselves.  So, at some point in the future, we will undoubtedly get a subpoena from a government, containing a lawful request for our cooperation with some law enforcement investigation.  At that point, we have three options: we could become criminals ourselves, by failing to comply; we could comply; or we could cease operation in the country of the request.  As a matter of policy, we rule out the first option.  The third option is reasonable if we feel that the request is immoral or fails to uphold the government's responsibility to protect its citizens.  But if we pull that trigger too many times, we ourselves fail to protect people, because we'll be unavailable to too many of them.  Which leaves the second option: complying with lawful requests for cooperation when they're moral and reasonable under the circumstances.  We're spending a fair amount of thought on how best to reconcile transparency and legal compliance, and we've got a panel of regulatory and privacy law experts who have agreed to put some time into that question on our behalf.  With luck, we'll be able to get that done in the first half of this year.Now, as to the question of whether law enforcement have fewer places to search...  Since we don't collect PII, there's nothing to search.  LE would need to request collection of future data.  And even that is not a capability we currently have.  The alternative is not some hypothetical decentralized system invisible to law enforcement; the alternative exists and is currently in use:  http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/5/6/nsa-chief-google.html. If someone has the capability to run their own resolver, they're not the target audience of Quad9.  If they have an IT department capable of contracting with IBM X-Force or Cisco Umbrella, they're not the target audience of Quad9.  Quad9's target audience is people whose privacy would otherwise be for sale.The other thread you cite was a tinfoil-hat guy who just made a bunch of stuff up.  There's an objective reality, and that wasn't related to it, even indirectly.  I'm happy to answer questions, but that wasn't questions either.	
6927	 LycanrocNet	 Hmm, to give you an idea, imagine yourself (or someone else) before you acquired the knowledge about privacy-invasive applications, systems, and services, in the world of accepting EULAs without reading them. Would you/they have selected a service that didn't "work as well" as another service, when you/they didn't bother to read what either of them were doing with your/their data?Just my thoughts. There likely is much more to it.	
6928	 ThePenultimateOne	 Also the fact that all the apps on there are required to be open source. If even a few sets of eyes look at the code, it's far less likely to have anything bad. And they tag anything that comes to have a known vulnerability.	
6929	 LinearActuator	 The OS can access any data on the hard drive regardless of wether it's connected to the internet. Even if you're disconnected from the internet, and the OS or other malware are tracking your usage or data, there's nothing stopping them from storing that data and transmitting it once you reconnect to the internet.	
6930	 redditor_1234	 The [initial press release](https://www.eff.org/press/releases/eff-and-lookout-uncover-new-malware-espionage-campaign-infecting-thousands-around) that the EFF published about that was not very clear. After they read it, [many people on Twitter were confused as to whether or not Signal was still safe to use](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/954171556455788544). As a direct result, the EFF published [a clarifying follow-up blog post](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2018/01/dark-caracal-good-news-and-bad-news).TL;DR: The report does not mean that Signal or the other IM apps themselves are compromised in any way. A group of people behind an espionage campaign (Dark Caracal) have directed people to their own websites (secureandroid[.]info, etc.; there’s a list in the appendix of the 50 page report) and tricked them into installing fake (trojanized) versions of various Android applications. (iOS is not affected.) The fake versions contained a piece of malware (Pallas) that was capable of collecting a range of sensitive user information, including recorded audio, call logs, conversations from popular chat applications, location information, browsing history, device specific metadata, contacts, etc."[Google has identified the apps associated with this actor, none of the apps were on the Google Play Store. Google Play Protect has been updated to protect user devices from these apps and is in the process of removing them from all affected devices.](https://blog.lookout.com/dark-caracal-mobile-apt)""[The Dark Caracal report is a reminder that the most dangerous things online for most people are well-crafted phishing messages and fake apps impersonating legitimate ones.](https://twitter.com/EFF/status/954546019634626561)"

6935	 Angeldust01	 That's kinda true, but it's not as straightforward as that. If they know only an IP and you live in a dormitory(for example) with an open wifi, you're unlikely to get conviced. On the other hand, if you live alone and don't have wifi, you'd have hard time arguing it wasn't you who did the downloading.	
6936	 wrexthor	 Which is great, in theory. In practice I don't think there are that many spending their Saturday nights looking through the source code of all the apps up there. And every update can introduce new features. I'm all for open source and love having alternatives like fdroid, but don't fool yourself into thinking it's secure.It's all about trusting someone else. 	
6937	 toper-centage	 You really think snapchat is not recording all the data you send?... 	
6938	 Bluebugjuice2	 So even if this computer was never to acess the internet, the OS can still be accessed by its creators? This must be the case for all OS then?

6940	 adolpwned	 To submit an app to the F-Droid's system you must provide the source code and it must be capable of be built with fdroidserver tools. Otherwise, they don't accept it.Simply and clear.Also they have a list of anti-features, such a Play Services' dependencies, which they don't accept it.It's pretty awesome and well maintained.

6954	 sting_12345	 it is constitutional actually since you are not in teh country yet, and if you are NOT a US citizen then you don't get those rights anyway.  They are using a very very opaque area of the constitution to do this and we all know it's not meant to be that way but what can one do until they rewrite that amendment?  The guys below is right, use an android and flash TWRP and do a nandroid backup, it's a perfect image and encrypt it store one on tresorit or another E2E encrypted cloud or encrypt it yourself and upload to anywhere.  Then just download it when you get to your destination and then restore, all done. IF they use a loophole, then be damn sure you do too with encrypted cloud usage.	
6955	 sting_12345	 yeah insane isn't it?  My bank is one of the biggest in the world and they don't use it either LOL.  It's stupid.  Also their app when you check it uses a combination of both https and http to interact with your accounts which is just plain terrible.

6981	 Eidbi	 Kind of amusing to get so many downvotes for a comment, related to Android, in the privacy sub. Not related to you directly, as I don't know who downvoted me.My point is that OS itself is a huge spyware and tracking malware, so it doesn't matter what you use on it anyway. Majority of Android apps are closed-source, and you have no idea what they really do. To top it off, many of Android apps, including Firefox, and its F-Droid version, called Fennec, require a lot of unnecessary permissions, including camera and microphone. Sorry, but I can't trust a browser, which requires permission for camera and microphone. And it found its way into F-Droid, which proves, that this store is unreliable. And this is a FOSS app, made by Mozilla. Do I even need to explain on what scope all of the other apps, especially closed-source ones, can be misused? Also a lot of them depend on Google Store and send data to Google and third parties. This is what malware does. By using GPS, apps can track your location and send it god knows where as well. And prior to Android 6.0, you **couldn't even disable** those permissions. Don't get me wrong, though. All of this is also true for Windows. It is simply worse in Android's case, because phones, which are primary devices for use with Android OS have GPS, 3G, Bluetooth and a heck ton of other functions which can and **are** regularly misused by applications. Google itself monitors all your user activity and posts it in your Google account, which proves, that nothing you do on it is safe from watching. Android, in my opinion is definition of spyware, and hence malware.

7002	 fear_the_future	 theoretically the computer could transmit data via bluetooth or inaudible sounds to another device like your phone/smart TV/whatever. Many apps include ad-frameworks which already listen constantly to find out what TV ads you're watching so it wouldn't be too hard to do. But I still doubt Win10 does this, it's just not worth the trouble. 	
7003	 postlapsar	 People do realize that this is true of all borders, not just the US? A few months ago, there was an article in the press about how border agents seized a cell phone belonging to a NASA engineer that contained important government documents. The press never mentioned any concerns about this person bringing his NASA documents to a foreign country. The Chilean border agents could have seized it too. https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/02/a-nasa-engineer-is-required-to-unlock-his-phone-at-the-border/516489/"Bikkannavar was taken aback. The phone was Jet Propulsion Lab property, he explained, pointing out the barcode stuck to the back. It was his duty to protect its sensitive contents, and he couldn’t give out the passcode."So here is the rub. He was "taken aback" that he had to provide sensitive US government documents  to US government agents, but had no problem bringing his phone to another country where it could have been subject to search by foreign government agents. The Canadian government can take/search phones too, without warrant, based only on suspicion. https://globalnews.ca/news/3268531/cellphone-search-at-the-border-cbsa/I don't take my phone across borders, just a burner with the basics needed to communicate. If it gets taken, no big loss. Same for laptops. I take an old “burner” laptop that gets wiped after each trip.	
7004	 wrexthor	 Im sorry if i came accross harshly. Fdroid is from the reply earlier probably  better controlled than Android store, but from what i can tell it's still an automated control and we all know from Android how easily they can be circumvented. My points about updates adding features still stand. Automatically rejecting certain features (blacklisting) is never efficient against a dedicated adversary. It does protect against simple/bad attacks, which might be a majority. The official Android store also does code scanning to some extent.So again to the point i made in the first post, the reason for a more secure enviroment is the small amount of users. Advanced attackers rather spend their energy where the majority of users are.And again, i use and love Fdroid, but it's all about trust as the system itself, like all software repositories that does not have staff dedicated to code audit (even then it's trust, humans can be bribed etc).	
7005	 JeffersonsSpirit	 &gt; Why are so many willing to trade privacy for convenience?I have a long and short answer. Short: Convenience's benefits are immediately apparent (its costs more obscure), while privacy's benefits are more obscure, more abstract, and less demonstrable in the conventional form (and its costs immediately apparent).Long: brain time is expensive, and as such human beings strive to automate as much of their activities as possible. There are really two-tiers- conscious time and subconscious time. Think of the first time you had to go somewhere- you either offloaded navigation to your GPS or consciously considered your route; you had to consciously analyze traffic tendencies so you could be in the right lanes for your turns, etc. Over time as you travel this route over and over, all of the tasks became more automatic- many of these tasks are eventually handled subconsciously. Subconscious thought is more efficient and less expensive, but requires repetition to establish certain patterns. Consider a football player, a soccer player, etc: while they will always utilize conscious thought in their game, the purpose of practice is to automate as much of their moves as possible since it is more efficient and less exhausting. If you went out 1 on 1 against a professional soccer player- even if you were 3 times smarter than him- he would absolutely destroy you on the field because of what he has managed to train his subconscious to do automatically- he's more efficient, more accurate, and expends less mental energy moving the ball around than you do.Where I'm going with this: technology in many ways functions as an extension of our subconscious. As the world is vast and complicated, we constantly strive to increase our operative efficiency, and thus technology is chosen based on what technology allows us to do the most with the least expenditure of mental energy. Convenience is one term for this automation.Privacy *in the current paradigm* on the other hand requires concessions of convenience- requires less efficient and more expensive action by people as they move through social or physical space- and thus is naturally destroyed by a hyper-competitive world where every fraction of efficiency matters.It doesn't have to be this way though. The reality is that perverse intellectual property laws, corporate lobbying, corporate campaign finance, deregulation etc has allowed for monopolies and powerful centralized entities *to make privacy expensive.* It is entirely possible that more modest profits could be made while preserving privacy, but the current paradigm is to convert every last fraction of value into profits for corporate entities. These corporate monopolies have the means to *force* a world where privacy is *more and more expensive* and thus one where people value it less in comparison to convenience.Another factor is lack of transparency- corporate entities use catchy slogans, advertising campaigns, cute mascots, etc to create *a friendly human image*. All the while they plot their schemes and cook up their weapons in the *shadows that we cannot see.* If people knew the language used in private boardrooms, the schemes plotted to control and manipulate, and most of all the *completely sociopathic degree* to which all of this occurs, they would be able to *see the actual price of convenience, and the relative bargain of privacy.* Alas, without transparency that is impossible. The government could do this, but alas again they are bought out by corporate interest. Its a great irony that the very corporations whose business model relies on destroying the privacy of their customers also necessarily rely on having privacy themselves to accomplish their aims. I don't think anything will change until the real cost of convenience is discovered by the masses; I dont think anything will change until calamity demonstrates the cost of privacy's destruction. We just have to hope that happens before it's too late...**EDIT** I think it could be said that privacy and convenience are both tools, and that they each aim to accomplish different things. Convenience increases efficiency, while privacy concerns itself with *the control of mental space.* In the current paradigm, corporations labor to create profit by controlling mental space, and they do so by destroying privacy via the carrot of convenience. By destroying privacy in the gathering of your data, they can understand what gets you to buy, target you, and ultimately control you. I think ultimately this is connected to a trend you can see almost everywhere you look: power centralization taken to the absolute extreme. Only when the People realize this and fight to take control of a larger share of power will we preserve privacy, reduce poverty, reduce wealth inequality, etc etc etc...	
7006	 _fake_name_here_	 I mean, I'd like them to try it so people will get sufficiently pissed off, but I think the Reddits of the world are more likely to acquiesce. Pornhub already has a for profit software solution ready to use if they don't want to build the technology in house.

7009	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Power always grows unless it is met by an equal or greater competing power. What's happening? The corporate/government conglomerate power is vastly outcompeting the People, and thus its power increases exponentially.Eventually it will bring a level of calamity that will catalyze an understanding in the dominant consciousness of the People of how centralized power is spiraling out of control, and the People will unite to resist that power. And then new leaders will be appointed and new rules will be made, and then the cycle will slowly repeat all over again.At least I hope the People jointly resist that power one day. We have never had a government/corporate/technology hydra of this scale oppress us before...You had damn well be filled with dread- dread is good as it demonstrates you know something is wrong. The one thing you and every one of us here need to be careful of though is not to let dread become apathy. The moment the impassioned minority stops actively fighting is the moment we're doomed.

7021	 GrabAMonkey	 Every time an app requires access to my contact list, I automatically assume that it's going to upload that information to their server, in order to use or sell the information. This means that only companies I trust to keep my data to themselves, will be allowed access to my contact list. Does *anyone* really trust some random company to not make money by selling off your private information, unless they have something to lose by doing so?	
7022	 Chateeleon	 Hey, sorry, my post had gotten delayed.  Basically, push notifications can be done a couple of ways.  The ones you get immediately after someone else has taken an action require that the app have info about your device.  Because how else do they know to initiate contact info with you?In my case, I don't store device info, so have no way to push back to a device.  Instead it relies only on a scheduled check to see if any new notifications have been generated.  The 'account' is nothing more than a set of randomly generated keys at first launch.  Without knowing what account you are on (Google/Apple) or a device identifier (Phone, MAC, etc) you can't send directly.  So polling a server at a timed interval is less convenient than having the response generated immediately after someone replies.

7028	 Chateeleon	 Hey, thanks for a very well thought out reply.  I do think that some of it is a lack of awareness of the abuse of that privacy, and I understand the importance of simplifying life.But while many claim to support privacy, in the next stroke they place Alexa in their homes.  Even working in a tech heavy field, I've had numerous coworkers who became horrified upon realizing that Alexa is always listening.  They just never connected the dots.  So I imagine the less tech savvy have no way to know.I feel that as you suggest, legislative correction is probably the only solution, but getting that passed is a challenge as well.  And how?  The EU has adopted a number of protective measures, where the US seems to fight against them in the name of corporate agility.  Do you require companies to clearly disclose what they are doing (not just Terms of Service)?  Do you create a ratings board?  Or is it an issue of things like the Third Party Doctrine where companies are almost encouraged to gather such info to make investigative and protective measures easier.

7030	 Chateeleon	 Thats probably the simple answer.  People care that it works well and are willing to make some sacrifices.  But it becomes a slippery slope of what those sacrifices are.  I understand that need.  Its just that it also creates a greater burden for everyone that wants to maintain that privacy by doing so.  I imagine many would be horrified by the level of data collection, but the "If I'm not doing anything wrong why should I care" theme is a common argument even in governmental monitoring.	
7031	 j_platte	 So why not offer your users a simple switch where they can tell you to save their device ID? Then you just send an empty push notification whenever something happens to which the app responds by doing the usual poll. No sensitive data sent over Google or Apple's servers, and you only save a small amount of data for those users that want a little more convenience.	
7032	 bitb0y	 Sweet, thank you!	
7033	 mdl054	 IMO since you sound like you know a little bit about what you're doing, why not ditch Windows entirely and look into VFIO? /r/vfioI understand games probably aren't your motivation for keeping Windows but the same concept applies. It's what I do (also not for games). I need mine for work and it suits my needs well. I'll never run Windows natively ever again. 	
7034	 share_me_plz	 Don't know of any, but it would be awesome if someone made a plugin for [GNUCash](https://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Building#Tutorial_on_Plugins).	
7035	 share_me_plz	 If Torbirdy is properly configured, the ISP will see nothing. The Tor exit node can still sniff metadata, although the message content itself is still encrypted due to Engimail/GnuPG.	
7036	 share_me_plz	 E-mail is completely flawed by design. Only r/BitMessage and MixMailers offer some level privacy so as long as you are behind Tor.Even if you used a "totally private" e-mail provider, the metadata would still leak, and that's what mass surveillance is collecting. (Time/Date/To/From/keywords/patterns)	
7037	 share_me_plz	 My bank only allows 8 character passwords. Yahoo can take over 200. The irony is real.	
7038	 share_me_plz	 If you must use Google, use [StartPage](https://startpage.com) or [Searx](https://search.disroot.org). Never use Google directly.	
7039	 GrabAMonkey	 I use [wire](https://wire.com/en/) for that purpose. It does require email registration, but you could potentially use a disposable email account for that purpose. Wire supports Windows 7+, Android, iOS, macOS, Linux and web browsers. Wire contains end to end encryption and doesn't require access to your contacts.	
7040	 JQuilty	 Get off the Fox News train. There's nothing nefarious about the 9th Circuit.

7044	 j_platte	 &gt; Once you pull device info, you basically have everything to tie to an individual.Do you though? Sounds easy for Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon, .. but unless the device IDs associated with a Google / Apple account are somehow publicly visible, I don't see how you could easily get personal information from a device ID.Either way, my point is that you should be giving your users an opt-in for the convenience features they get elsewhere. Otherwise you will just make people who are less concerned about privacy move to your competition, who will most likely store much more than just device information. (side note: opt-ins should ideally offer the user a way of learning more about why the feature they enable isn't on by default, and the specific consequences of opting in)

7052	 Chateeleon	 Sadly, yes.  Once device info permission is granted, you get the phone number, IP, carrier, MAC, etc.  So it can all be stored.	
7053	 jpcosco	 I made some progress. I found [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/discordapp/comments/6xf1kl/i_verified_my_email_why_is_discord_asking_for_my/dmfe5te/) from a while ago which suggest my account has been flagged. So I got a new email and ip address and low and behold, no phone verification required. However, the desktop app still asks for it, so it appears that is still flagged even after reinstalling.

7057	 TrashMacNugget	 Many people are suggesting Tox. Just know it doesn't hide your IP by default, so if you use it, use it over Tor.	
7058	 TrashMacNugget	 For some phones, it will mean there is nothing unencrypted in RAM, and (I think) some phones have stricter password requirements the first time you unlock them after booting.	
7059	 bitb0y	 Okay thank you. So do you not use YouTube either? That seems like a huge bummmer to give up.. 	
7060	 jawz101	 &gt;Did Russian operatives use Facebook as a way to deepen the political divide in America during the 2016 Presidential election?Facebook has faced ongoing scrutiny for selling 3,000 ads to a Russian agency during the campaign — some of which were meant to deepen public disagreements about Muslims and the Black Lives Matter movement — leaving some to wonder just how much power Facebook holds in political discourse.I use ad/tracking blockers and I don't believe in this argument.  U.S. advertising for U.S. products is where the manipulation happens.  You visit this article and it's loading so much shit to try and track you for product purchase recommendations or whatever.

7064	 Harvey_Weinig	 Is it correct that this applies to both physical borders (Canada/Mexico) but also international airports? My understanding is that international airports (through some ridiculous/convoluted thinking) are subject to these same rules?Edit: Lots of ppl in other threads discussing novel ways of circumventing this gross intrusion (mail your phone across the border, use a burner, etc. etc.) I guess if we *have* to travel these are stop gaps, but not solutions. Remember Rosa Parks. If i feel strongly that a law/regulation is grossly unjust it's my responsibility to peacefully refuse complicity (Thomas Jefferson said so anyway).I don't know if I'll have the composure and guts to say, "I do not consent" but I hope I would. A permanent solution has to be at government regulation level, up to clarifying how 4th amendment applies. I do not want to live in an authoritarian  police state. I don't want the next generation to live in a police state.

7067	 somethingdecent1	 I agree that there are security issues with android (especially older versions), and privacy issues with the google framework. And even F-droid stated that firefox has anti-features (now they don't even carry it in their repo). That said, using a custom rom without Google Play such as Lineage or CoppperheadOS that's over Android 6 which supports individual permissions, and only using FOSS apps from f-droid is hardly in my opinion. Granted, it's not perfect as there are still binary blobs in the baseband and modem firmwares, but it's the best we've got until the linux based librem phone comes out.	
7068	 Vinhsynd	 Open source is the best we have... but remember the Ken Thompson ACM Hack. Cited below for young people:https://www.win.tue.nl/~aeb/linux/hh/thompson/trust.htmlAt the end of day we always have to trust in people.	
7069	 Jerkboy13	 I think it’s even more likely in int’l airports. But yes, it definitely applies there as well.	
7070	 Chateeleon	 Yeah, and I try to go really light on that.  Entirely optional, and users set their own schedule (15min - Daily).  But without those notifications, a lot of people just don't check in.  The convenience side.  I don't mind that personally.  I don't need notifications to check in on an app if I like it.  But there is likely some psychology at play and nudging going on when it's used.  Until it drives people to uninstall.

7087	 astrobase_go	 the privacy concerns over obd2 readers are worse wrt just a cell phone or 4G hotspot because its position data can / is paired with all of the other telemetry data it would collect as well: car make and model, driving characteristics and habits (acceleration / negative acceleration intensity, turn g-forces, etc), mileage, and so on. something like hum is built-to-specification for aggregating all of that data and phoning home with at least some (and potentially all) of it; a phone riding shotgun, while it has the sensors to collect most of the non-automotive data, has to run some sort of program or sip data to aggregate and ship a meaningful snapshot of your activities. it seems like a standalone hotspot wouldn't even have the accelerometers, barometers, and other sensors that could be used to gather that data.like most issues in data privacy, you can make it more difficult for others by federating devices and forcing "the others" to calculate, aggregate, or compute that data on their own (see: multi-source information fusion). so anyone who's interested in knowing that about you has to somehow do that with outboard tools. hum's attractive to those who want a lot of information about drivers because it does all of that work for them in one little device that's easy to install.if you are worried about the privacy implications of something like that, see if you can get a standalone [4G hotspot](https://www.verizonwireless.com/internet-devices/verizon-jetpack-4g-lte-mobile-hotspot-ac791l/).

Alexa: "I do not lie"Friend: "Are you sending information to the NSA?"Alexa: "..."Tired it a few times and it refuses to answer. Of course no one was shocked. It was just kind of interesting. I'd honestly be more concerned with what they're sending other data companies, though.

7106	 arviceblot	 Unless some better suggestions pop up, you might want to check out [Delta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.getdelta.android). It's not open source, but it's permissions are a bit less intrusive than Blockfolio.	
7107	 millwrightastronomer	 [Also relevant - it impacts you even if you don't use Google](https://mako.cc/copyrighteous/google-has-most-of-my-email-because-it-has-all-of-yours). so encourage more people to switch away.the hard part is that Gmail is *so much better* than the next best competitor, it makes it extremely hard to switch.	
7108	 Socio77	 I have found that configuring your browser to delete cookies does not always delete all the cookies.It is better to run your browser in a sandbox this way no cookies gets saved and neither does your browsing history.The only down side is you will need to manually log into sites you frequent each time you go there but what a couple extra clicks to make sure your browser is clean every time you shut it down.

7117	 biz_owner	 Don't use gmail, or any other free email.  We got used to free email accounts in the 90s, which were private but annoying with flashing banner ads.  But since early 2000s, they started reading your emails and collecting metadata.  Now your only option is to pay for it.	
7118	 rudditte	 On the same matter, does SwiftKey share typing data just as Google Keyboard would? 	
7119	 jonbelanger	 yeah that's what I did instead - the LTE hot spot is only a $35 device now, whereas the hum is $110.  If I had young teenagers driving the car I would think more seriously about hum.	
7120	 letsreticulate	 The reality is that assuming companies you decide to go with stick to proper privacy policies, the only real option is to pay for it.Your other option is to self-host, either at home or third party. However that requires a pretty step learning curb that most people are just not willing to do. Not to mention, pay for it.  Personally, I have some share hosting and own a few domains, for myself and the SO, plus I had to learn some server, and backend basics. So, my email is on my own shared server. I do not get crazy spam, but objectively speaking I do get more than when using Gmail, so you have to be a tad more careful, but nothing overly complicated.Going fully self-hosted is not something many people can afford or have the time to really care to learn or upkeep, regardless of how much they might complain about privacy.

As of right now, I'll take Google reading my email over Russia, North Korea, China, hackers, etc. I feel that you take more of a risk hosting yourself if you don't know how to secure your server. Even if you do, you're most likely not watching exploit databases 24/7 for new exploits to your server like google. It's all about tradeoffs. 	
7145	 sting_12345	 That is YOUR interpretation.  The one that matters is the Supreme Court and they have ruled that the DATA on your phone is not your property, like your email, or location data.  They all belong to the ones who provide the service for free.Also you are incorrect, the entire bill of rights only pertains to US citizens, that's why they don't write it out every single time.  You cannot violate the civil rights of a non US citizen.  That law 'violation of civil rights' was put into place during the 'mississippi burning' period because there is no Federal Murder statute and the southern states were so corrupt they woudn't stop the murders.  SO they made this law punishable by 20 years mandatory minimum in prison.  Read some history books.

7158	 yozuo	 That's not correct. If you want anonymized Google results go for Startpage. Using !g does not get you Google results *inside* DuckDuckGo. It directs your search to google.com directly, thus google will be able log your IP, search terms, browser fingerprint and any other available info.

7164	 yozuo	 To add on this: [Here](https://gist.github.com/dllud/a46d4a555e31dfeff6ad41dcf20729ac) is a list of public XMPP that provide an onion address in addition to their clearnet address and don't ask for any information in order to register.	
7165	 Dazurean	 So in those instances, can you request the pictures be removed? 	
7166	 Disclandr	 Brave only supports extension for Lastpass and Bitwarden as far as i can tell. Try SlimJet browser instead.  Very similar privacy tools as Brave but it supports all normal chrome extensions so that gives you many, many choices in password manager.   	
7167	 Disclandr	 If you mean to install both Linux and Winshit on the same ssd drive than yes, That is a good idea.  And then you can mount /home to the larger hard-drive and also you can create an NTFS partition (2nd partition) also on the larger hard-drive and mount all your personal Windows files (like pictures, documents, downloads) also.  Thats how my set-up is and it makes it easier to manage my backups to have my personal files on a different partition than my OS   	
7168	 Disclandr	 This has been covered on past forum threadsWindows cannot read ext4 without somebody adding the ext4 drivers and that is even with non-encrypted linux.  I dont think Windows gives a fuck to spy on Linux since its less than 2% of total desktop users.  	
7169	 CryptoxGEEK	 So basically she is promoting shitcoins... Sorry, dropped in from the crypto bloggs, stumbled into you privacy comments an just could not resist a jab...

7217	 Isometric_mappings	 Hm, I never knew about that app. I looked into it and it's definitely a lot more complete than my own. The thing with having a general purpose encrypted file viewer is that you need "viewers" for all doc types. Which for photos is not too hard, although even for that I used another FOSS project to get a nice, zoomable image. For something like pdfs, you'd need to find a nice open source project that is compatible with GPL-3, then the rest is easy. Videos on the other hand are much harder, since you can't load up the entire file into RAM.I submitted this app to fdroid a week ago. I've gotten *zero* feedback of any kind from them. It seems like some apps just sit there for weeks-months until they eventually get approved or declined. 	
7218	 RobotQueue	 &gt; The Echo units have two main "modes." The first is a small firmware chip wired to the microphone that only contains about 50-60k of onboard memory. Its only purpose is to listen to the wake word, "Alexa," "Echo," etc. It doesn't do any actual language processing for this, but only listens for distinct combinations of syllables. This is why they can't be programmed to respond to arbitrary words.&gt; Once the firmware chip hears the wake word, it powers up the main ARM chip, which runs a stripped down version of Linux. This startup process takes just under a second, during which time the firmware chip has barely enough memory to buffer what you're saying if you immediately start talking after the wake word without pausing. Once the ARM chip is on, the blue ring on the top illuminates and recording begins. The firmware chip dumps its buffer to the start of the recording and then serves as a pass-through for the mic. Only this main ARM chip and OS has access to the networking interface, in or out.https://np.reddit.com/r/Showerthoughts/comments/7m91u9/if_google_devices_only_start_listening_once_you/drsdxe1/?sh=c90d0649&amp;st=JBO70BSD

7231	 Axidiel	 It’s not that simple.The tablet will have the same IP address as your other devices on the same network, so it can all be linked together.Netflix has your email address, which can link your viewing habits to data collected by other services.Netflix has your payment information, which can also be used to identify you.I wish it were this simple, but you’ve only made it marginally more difficult for them.

7237	 onlyonebyte	 OsmAnd (OpenStreetMaps) is great if you're on Android and want to avoid Google Maps. Depending on your area, OSM is just as good as Google Maps. Google is quite pushy on wanting you to see where you travel, of course, we all know what happens with that data. :) On computer, I'd use Google Maps as you can do a lot of blocking with your browser while on phone, I'd highly recommend OsmAnd.

7251	 not-a-spoon	 What is that site? Some of those articles are straight up crazy.	
7252	 ReturningTarzan	 There's a [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/) that works much better. I believe it's also available for Chrome.It deletes any cookie as soon as you close the last tab using that cookie, and you can still whitelist sites to retain cookies in certain cases. So for instance you can still stay logged into Reddit if you don't consider that too much of a concern.Of course cookies are only a small part of the puzzle. They allow sites to tag your browser so the server can easily recognize it in the future, and you definitely shouldn't let untrusted sites do that. But it's far from the only thing you have to worry about. And installing a proprietary, closed-source extension like Ghostery hardly covers all those other concerns. For all we know Ghostery is mining your data and selling it just like everyone else.uMatrix and uBlock Origin make a big difference, though. They're very good at controlling which scripts are allowed to run in your browser and they're both FOSS.	
7253	 KopfKrieg	 Quick question: Did you try to reset your profile?	
7254	 JavierTheNormal	 Zerohedge... hmm. Sometimes they post insightful articles nobody else will touch, sometimes they seem off their rocker. I leave it to you to judge for yourself, because no media outlet is reliable. Most are more subtle than Zerohedge, which arguably makes Zerohedge a better source. At least you can tell when they're deceiving you.	
7255	 _b3yond	 It's about time something like this comes around the corner.Every time I throw a cryptoparty, the key management stuff is too complicated and people drop PGP because they don't know anyone who uses it, too.Autocrypt has the potential to finally change that, will definitely recommend that in the future. This is what you want to give to tech illiterate users.	
7256	 T0X1C	 Try to reset it or check if any addon is causing the crash. From the 3-lined menu - Help - Restart with Add-Ons disabled.

7258	 torku	 You shouldn’t blindly state these opinions without supporting them. Open source is preferable but Apple does not have a reputation for putting back donors in software. So where do you get that information? 	
7259	 3x0byte	 Hi, /u/billwoodcock! I do have some questions:1. It was mentioned by /u/Quad9DNS that there are plans to do an audit of Quad9 which will be made available to the public. Is there any estimate as to when this will happen?2. According to [privacytools.io](https://privacytools.io/), it is believed that services based in the US, or any Five Eyes/Fourteen Eyes countries, are a concern when it comes to privacy. Quote: “Quad9 is a US-based 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation”. Are there any plans to provide DNS service from countries based outside of Five Eyes/Fourteen Eyes?3. There are some who are concerned that Quad9's approach to security could result in a form of censorship based on what Quad9 believes to be a security risk. By comparison, DNS services such as DNS Watch make the claim that they don't censor the web. What reassurances can you provide that content won't be censored in a way that users of your service might find questionable?4. How does Quad9 compare to other DNS-over-TLS services, like the one made available for Android devices and open/community-driven projects such as [Stubby](https://github.com/getdnsapi/stubby)?

7261	 RobotQueue	 And the midwife could have inserted a microphone in your ass at birthAnd squirrels could be hyper intelligent and controlling the UN today Its pointless to discuss “they could” scenarios when most people in this thread are making assumptions that are trivially tested as false 	
7262	 MrAxlee	 You look after your own database. You don't rely on promises of "no backdoors" (even if you believe them, it's better to not have to). Completely free without any limits, and open source.Can LastPass work offline? A lot of my passwords are offline (Encrypted drives, NAS', various PCs, routers) and it'd suck if my internet went down and I couldn't access some of those.	
7263	 LatticeCrypted	 &gt; Is there any way to tell whether somebody is using an IMSI catcher to snoop on you?I believe there's an app for that. AIMSICD.&gt;Also why would turning off GSM fallback or turning on LTE only mess up your service? Not every location has LTE service, your phone often falls back on GSM in certain reception areas.	
7264	 ABaseDePopopopop	 If you don't understand that people here don't trust closed-source products, especially when they are technically able to listen to everything you say and do, and come from a company that has a financial and legal incentive to use that information and a history of doing so, you're not in the right subreddit.	
7265	 kaips1	 The 3 things you want prevent what you are looking for. It can happen but not under your preferences. Automation and convenience kill the security built by the anonymity.

7274	 kaips1	 Have you done any actual research on this? I suggest you search till you find a logical solution. Its possible to stay anonymous and use cash to buy disposable cards, things like reload and online anything will kill your ability to stay secure, so obviously dont use those feature or use cards that have those features. 	
7275	 theendisnear111	 yup. this seems like the only logical and effective solution.	
7276	 dhskajdhaiaoxjcjskzl	 Chiming in my iOS adblocking tips here, there’s an paid app called Adguard Pro which can block ads and trackers systemwide on iPhone(and also Mac). It works on both mobile and wifi, and the blacklist is customizable. For me(my threat model is quite low), I use my system default DNS settings, copied ad domain and tracker names from somewhere and pasted in the blacklist, and block both ads and trackers from apps on my phone. You can also monitor which DNS requests go through your network. I have tried Disconnect Pro app(got the it when it went free some time ago) but I find the in app purchase that allows you to customize your domain blacklist extremely expensive.As for browsers, I mentioned earlier that my threat model is low so I use Safari with a content blocker and DuckDuckGo as search engine.

7286	 Vinhsynd	 Officially it’s classified as a financial site. However this is how Time describes the site in their Top 25 Finance sites article:*Here is how I can tell when I’ve been reading Zero Hedge too much. I find myself rolling my eyes at CNBC or the Wall Street Journal while saying things like “There’s more to it than that!” or “Suuuure, it may seem that way.” I know Canadian equity strategist David Rosenberg’s latest perma-bearish musings, and the same from the preternaturally gloomy Albert Edwards of Société Générale. After prolonged exposure, I have to turn off my wi-fi not to sell all my U.S. dollars for physical gold, start an anti–Goldman Sachs blog and buy a Kansas soybean farm protected by a moat.But here is the crazy thing: Zero Hedge — a morning zoo of pessimistic financial blogging — is fun. Granted, you (O.K., I) can’t read it for long without the aforementioned soybean-farmer effect, but the downbeat site has found an entertaining niche at the intersection of The X-Files, finance and tireless anti–Goldman Sachs–ishness.So while I don’t read Zero Hedge regularly — it’s too bearish, too conspiratorial and too much of an intellectual monoculture — I like knowing that it exists. Any time I’m feeling like things might just turn out O.K. on planet Economic Earth, I know where to turn to be disabused of that stupid idea.*

7298	 CoaxingManual	 He probably can’t muster anything more than [this link](https://8ch.net/tech/ddg.html) that was already posted in the thread. The recommendation is a copy/paste from that link. Virtual he said/she said here — not a reputable source to be found. The “sources” from that link are a Wikipedia page, an article written by the creator of DDG literally announcing the existence of DDG around launch, and a blog post from 2013.    Don’t forget the blog post is used to raise the “USA equals NSA and is the devil” argument, stating matter-of-factly that EU hosting is better. I guess we’re just forgetting about the mandatory data retention laws in effect across most of the EU but that gets in the way of the circlejerk.             Why we take 8chan as truth over all is beyond me, but there you have it.

7315	 quote_work_unquote	 Really like the redesign on Android. I never liked the "stories" section or the fact that if you browsed results within the DDG app itself it didn't act like a secure browser. This is much cleaner and simpler, and has a button to delete all your browsing history/cookies before you exit. Seems like a solid step forward for the Android app at the very least. EDIT: Alright, so the only thing that annoys me is they removed the search widget. I had the DDG search widget in place of the google widget at the bottom of my OG Pixel home screen since I bought it. Rather annoying to lose it. But I did find a workaround that essentially accomplishes the same thing. Download Brave Browser, set DDG as your default search engine within Brave, and then add the Brave search widget to your home screen. Voila. 	
7316	 Gaff3r	 Any registrar worth their salt should allow url redirection. 	
7317	 toper-centage	 There are open source IMs encrypted end-to-end by default. Snapchat terms and conditions for sure includes something like "you allow us to handle your pictures" because that is a necessity of any such service. But any promise of encryption of confidentiality should not be taken seriously.

7319	 vinnl	 ...and `!s` for StartPage :)	
7320	 _EleGiggle_	 Startpage uses Google results and DDG has results that Google censored.	
7321	 _EleGiggle_	 Not sure why you are getting down voted. Startpage does in fact return Google results.	
7322	 vinnl	 So it's basically an extension that combines Disconnect+HTTPS Everywhere+ToS;dr and allows them to plug their search engine? Sounds reasonable.Speaking of ToS;dr: they could really use help [classifying new ToS's](https://tosdr.org/). With a donation by DDG they're working on [a new web interface](https://phoenix.tosdr.org/) for contributing, so giving that a test drive can be really helpful.	
7323	 berkes	 Redirect is the HTTP layer, domain registration the DNS layer.They have absolutely nothing to do with one another, so it's perfectly fine for a registrar to stay away from http(Web hosting).	
7324	 ambiguousmango	 From what i understand they use google's search engine but basically use startpage as a proxy so that none of your information (apart from what you actually search) is sent to google.	
7325	 lolbertarian4america	 I feel you, I never owned an Android phone that wasn't partially broken in some way requiring a third party fix from XDA.  Usually the GPS (fuck you Samsung, I was stupid to own 3 different Galaxy phones before I got the hint).  I recently tried a Google Pixel for the first time and have loved it for the month I've had it.  It's the FIRST Android I've ever owned that I haven't modded, put custom ROM's on or even rooted.  It's Google doing Apple's thing: design the hardware, design the operating system in the same house.  It works exactly as its supposed to, pure Android no extra crap from Samsung slowing it down and draining your battery.I've wanted Google to take more control of Android to deal with all the fragmentation and incompatibility issues for years.  The Nexus phones were a halfassed attempt, but the Pixel really got it right.  While Apple continues pushing out half-assed updates (for example the third party keyboard API from iOS 8 is still completely broken YEARS LATER, can't even use functioning swipe on iOS) and now the battery, overheating and incompatibility issues that have been going on for months since iOS 11 released.  Last straw for me.I'm having fun in Android land.  Not rooting keeps the app sandboxing intact, and everything has worked great so far.  Took me a while to get my Android Wear watch the way I liked it, that could definitely use some work compared to Apple Watch, but I downloaded a custom watch launcher and configured it to do exactly what I want, it just took more fussing than Apple usually does.I'd love to see a third mobile OS come out (not you Windows you're only used on desktops by default) but nothing really promising seems to be in the pipeline.

7367	 Jzargos_Helper	 [Here’s a bunch of other bangs too](https://duckduckgo.com/bang). Bangs alone make DDG worth it for me. 	
7368	 Bendi888	 That s because starter page shows Google results and DDG has results that Google censored.

7378	 Jzargos_Helper	 Another guy that responded to me suggested using !s Instead because it uses startpage which is basically google without the google. I just tried it and it works perfectly too.

7381	 millwrightastronomer	 Things that should be basic and ubiquitously available but isn't. The obvious example is labels, which *nobody* else has. Another is proper conversation view, which as far as i can tell only Gmail, outlook, and fastmail has, and outlook only relatively late at that (they had conversation view in reverse order for a long time). Certainly no other service holds a candle to gmail's search and, more importantly, robust filter system (although its got it's own quirks, like not clearly defined hierarchy).I've found that fastmail comes closest in feature parity, the only major feature it's missing is labels.	
7382	 identicalBadger	 I have to remember this! Thanks! 	
7383	 identicalBadger	 I was hoping that it would return me Google results on the DDG page. But that sent me to Google, which nullifies the point of being at DDG in the first place...

7385	 steezy13312	 I wonder how this compares to Privacy Badger. I'll have to check it out when I get home.

7387	 AnotherCupOfTea	 wut? It's a tool, not their actual site.	
7388	 lykla	 That doesn't perform a proper redirect.	
7389	 seanprefect	 The answer is it probably will be traceable, especially if you log into any accounts that can be traced back to you. And VPNs aren't magic shields, honestly if you're that concerned about privacy then there are better devices to use .	
7390	 jojo_31	 Yeah that is much needed. No one want to contribute if they have to invest time just learning how they can do it. 	
7391	 Elm-tree-time	 That's the point, you can get google quality results without giving google info about you	
7392	 IsopropylWick	 Searx is open source and the instances I'm talking about are run by well established free software community and associations.

7394	 noteventhatgreat	 So the extension includes what HTTPS Everywhere does? Might as well delete that extension now then.	
7395	 Zulban	 How so?	
7396	 quote_work_unquote	 As a full browser, Brave and Firefox are always going to be better than something like this. They have more robust settings, tabbed browsing, etc.This is now pretty close to Firefox Focus. A simple browser where you can search for something, browse it, and then nuke your history. 	
7397	 SenorDevil	 I am a novice but the one setting I really appreciate in SP is having it delete all history etc when you close out of it. 	
7398	 RobotQueue	 The device you used to post is capable of doing that.  All I have done is posted what is actually happening and how you can verify it trivially. A child could do it.  I can see the community is not interested in realities and would prefer to pretend Alexa is recording everything and obsess over it rather than even bother to check. To me, that means you aren’t interested in helping improve the state of privacy.	
7399	 Aphix	 Thanks! However changing that muscle memory might take a bit =PThe regex used for the bang syntax is quite a sight to behold, you can find it in the clientside JS if you're curious-	
7400	 pfaccioxx	 no but I mean dos'nt StartPage use google technology/code for there site's stucere? (cos blocking proxiying stuff so google can't see what your looking for means nothing if the proxy is part of google/is sending data to google... or am I misunderstanding how the site works in that regard?)

7403	 startled_easily	 Any suggestions for better devices?	
7404	 bumblebritches57	 They're getting back at goolag for redirecting duck.com	
7405	 Tib5	 I suppose you could substitute this with HTTPS Everywhere, but I wouldn't go from Privacy Badger if you've pre-configured it. Reason being, it seems like DuckDuckGo Essentials, uses a form of tracker list, similar to a lot of other privacy extensions. The reason Privacy Badger beats that is that the add-on detects everything a site is using, and not just what's on a list somewhere. This would allow you to block not just trackers that aren't listed, but also harmful scripts found on some site. The downside to Privacy Badger, I find is that the default mode (where the Badger "learns") is pretty bad, and in that case an app like DuckDuckGo Essential would be better at protecting you. Once again, it'a all about convenience and (DDG Essentials) and complexity (PB).	
7406	 seanprefect	 If you're asking for a smart phone that can meaningfully access the internet without leaving any possible way of tying you to it.. no i can't  think of one probably some white label chinese one running a weird os would be the most likely. iPhones are just particularly bad because of their close ties to apple, that said google is much more interested in keeping tabs on where you are...	
7407	 Neuromante	 I think I got lost a bit ago on the privacy-related extensions a while ago...I'm using Privacy Badger, HTTPS Everywhere, uBlock Origin, and Decentraleyes. Is this of any use given my current setup or it helps with something else? I thought that Privacy Badger were already stepping on Disconnect, but it seems this is also stepping on Disconnect, so... I don't know what to do anymore.	
7408	 jaxupaxu	 Same, contents will be lost. Thats basically file corruption. The only way a TC file can be recovered from corruption is if the volume header is the only corrupted bit. If core data is corrupt there is no way.

7410	 zebbleganubi	 vivaldi has a pretty neat trick where you can just search the letter s with a space after it and then the search term to open startpage or whatever elsebangs are great but its also great not having to type shift+! at the start each time. (i know, im lazy)	
7411	 doorbellguy	 Hey that's great. Can anyone explain the difference between both these please?I mean I'm aware startpage provides through Google but anonymously. What does adding !g does differently in DDG? Are these essentially the same thing?Also how is  !g fundamentally differently than !s? 	
7412	 strangethingtowield	 On Android before this update, I used the DDG widget for search and then loaded results externally in Firefox Focus (my default browser). With this update, the search widget is gone. Anyone know a workaround to use my previous workflow with a search widget for DDG (ideally to load results/links from results in FF Focus)?

7414	 zebbleganubi	 because we need to have other search engines besides google and ddg will hopefully improve the more popular it gets	
7415	 Edgecased	 A CNAME record is basically an alias in DNS. It says "Oh, you want CNAME.com? It's IP is wherever ARECORD.com is."	
7416	 Zulban	 How is that not a "proper" redirect? I understand it is not an HTTP redirect.	
7417	 Edgecased	 When the server receives the connection, it's still a request for CNAME.com and not for ARECORD.com. The CNAME just handles where the traffic should be sent- it does not change the request.

7419	 King-Fluffy	 Not quite. That EU Data Retention Directive (DRD) was made [invalid in 2014](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2014-04/cp140054en.pdf) as blanket data collection violates the EU [Charter of Fundamental Rights](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:12012P/TXT&amp;from=EN), in particular Article 7 (Respect for private and family life), and Article 8(Protection of personal data). The fact that the EU made the DRD invalid due to its attack on personal privacy is one of the reasons people prefer services hosted there.	
7420	 CoaxingManual	 Yes, quite. *Several* EU nations have these laws on the books even after the Ireland ruling. Source: [The EU itself](http://fra.europa.eu/en/theme/information-society-privacy-and-data-protection/data-retention)	
7421	 ahunt76	 CNAME just routes the packet to a certain IP address, the server still has to be configured to accept requests from that domain and return a redirect. If you have a domain, try creating a CNAME record and point it to google.com and see what happens, your request will be rejected by Google servers.

7427	 YioUio	 What about Firefox focus?	
7428	 shifty_pete	 Because Google is still collecting all that data. Probably knows who it is too.	
7429	 justanothersmartass	 https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/5ljgka/what_is_a_better_search_engine_duckduckgo_or/	
7430	 King-Fluffy	 True, there are countries that haven't changed their laws. And those laws are in violation of the charter. Once it was made invalid in 2014, not all country laws immediately changed, it takes years, some countries are lagging behind. The article you linked to discusses how different EU states are amending their laws in relation to data retention, and I think shows the change from having mandatory data retention to it being invalidated. I'm not sure how you can read that article and think "mandatory data retention", instead of "in the process of removing mandatory data retention".But to be fair it is true there are countries that have not yet removed their mandatory data retention laws. I wasn't saying you were completely wrong, just that it wasn't the whole story (hence my "not quite" - it wasn't meant to be snarky). I just felt additional information on the status of mandatory data retention in the EU was relevant to the conversation.	
7431	 _EleGiggle_	 I doubt that. If Startpage does all the requests for you, it's like using a proxy. Google never gets your IP, unless Startpage would share it with them. They also have a "European Privacy Seal", although I don't know what that entails.See https://www.startpage.com/eng/protect-privacy.html#hmb for more information.	
7432	 dlerium	 The problem is a bang is the equivalent of going to that site and searching for privacy. Google is encrypted (HTTPS) by default already so you're getting the same effect as going to Google and searching when doing !g.I do think it is a problem DDG results are so piss poor.	
7433	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
7434	 dlerium	 !g is the equivalent of going to Google.com and searching. Google is encrypted by default (https) so !g doesn't really offer much more. With that said !s should get you startpage results which protects you from being tracked by Google.	
7435	 dlerium	 Keep in mind from a privacy perspective, bangs are pretty much the equivalent of going to that site and searching. Bangs should be viewed more as a shortcut so that you only need to rely on one site/search query rather than having to open individual sites each time you want to search some topic.	
7436	 AlpacaKid	 Wait what, Brave tracks people?	
7437	 dlerium	 Yeah but Startpage results are way better IMO.	
7438	 mrjackspade	 Found the guy who doesn't understand anything about web technology	
7439	 dlerium	 You should read your link a bit more carefully. The big difference is when it comes to an ad. Clicking on a normal search link gives similar results. Google still collects your info at encrypted.google.comKeep in mind encrypted.google.com was developed years ago when Google didn't use HTTPS by default. Since 2016, Google uses https by default.	
7440	 suburban_smartass	 No. He even said at the end of his comment that he has no idea if they do or don't.	
7441	 LatticeCrypted	 It's always a good idea to rotate all your device information, hostname, mac address, bluetooth device name, board, brand, manufacturer, display id etc. 	
7442	 ToastyYogurtTime	 Vivaldi's code is proprietary so I can't trust it like I trust Firefox.Can't even trust it as much as Chromium.	
7443	 Basement_Nuke	 Encrypted Google doesn’t block Google from tracking you at all. Using StartPage.com (!sp) does, supposedly, though. 	
7444	 shifty_pete	 There's more than one way to get data. Probably easy enough to figure it out from cookies and every site running Google Analytics cross referenced with the search results. Google is getting their pound of flesh one way or another.	
7445	 eb11b	 Whats funny is I recommend Duckduckgo because of its privacy and got called Alt-right. 	
7446	 kurros	 It is the same principle as public VPN or Tor exits. Your search traffic is mixed in with the queries of everyone else using StartPage. Also being proxied this way means Google doesn't get to see your IP address or set tracking cookies. You just have to trust StartPage is being a good steward of your data.	
7447	 [deleted]	 What about 1Password? 	
7448	 CherryPlay	 I switched from keypass to bitwarden and love it, im apso using it on the newest Firefox. Maybe its a plugin thats crashing firefox

7450	 DrivingPenguin	 Hi, thats a great Tool! Thank you for sharing!Just a quick question, will I be able to install Windows 10 or Ubuntu in a Qubes Container?	
7451	 _EleGiggle_	 Google won't see your cookies either, and Startpage doesn't use Google Analytics, tracking scripts or tracking cookies. You can only set optional cookies for settings, which can be replaced by bookmarking a settings url. I assume Startpage pays for results and does caching, so they don't have to query Google for every search anyway.Google Analytics running on other websites is bad for privacy, but you can just block it with all common ad or tracking blockers.If you told me to search something with Google for you, and to send you the top 10 links, how would Google know that you asked me to, and that you didn't just visit a website from your bookmarks? Assuming that you block tracking.Edit: Clarified wording.	
7452	 irule	 What are the differences between those two and what are the advantages VS duckduck?	
7453	 AtBios	 How is Slimjet from a privacy perspective? This is the first time I hear about it. :D	
7454	 AtBios	 I am tempted to do that. However, wasn't a vulnerability discovered recently in Bitwarden?	
7455	 DodoDude700	 Windows 10: Qubes Windows Tools is for Windows 7 only as of now, as I understand it.Ubuntu: Yes, look into Qubuntu.	
7456	 hayden_evans	 Important to note for iOS users: it only works in the DuckDuckGo app. A lot of the headlines posted about this make it seem like it also includes a blocker extension that you can enable through settings for Safari. That is not the case. This is essentially a private browser app from DuckDuckGo for iOS.	
7457	 jko831	 It's source-available freeware.

7464	 loimprevisto	 !g sends you to the google page directly, so google will get the information about your query and associate it with your account or with the browser's advertising profile if you aren't logged in.!s returns the same results but doesn't use google's page. Google knows that the search was performed but doesn't tie it to your userid/advertising profile.	
7465	 vankawhite	 A CNAME is like asking “Hey, what’s the number for creepysite.com?” and it responds with “Oh, it’s the same number as google.com”. So you call the number for google.com and when Google answers, you ask “Can you serve me creepysite.com?” but Google responds “You must have the wrong number; there’s no creepysite.com here”.

7469	 quote_work_unquote	 I use both frequently and have found both to have pretty even pros and cons when it comes to results in my opinion. For what it's worth, as mentioned above you can simply start your DDG search with "!s" to get startpage results right through DDG

7475	 [deleted]	 Encrypted google is just their old service where the query goes over https rather than http, but these days it's all https so no one much uses it any more. Surely you don't think google can't track you by using that? They know your ip address etc just like you visited their site.It's amazing how many people think bangs to places like google will keep them private just because you've done it via DDG. You just have to look at the url's they create to see they don't (obviously going to, say, startpage is fine). 	
7476	 [deleted]	 What are you talking about? All I'm saying if you care about privacy you don't use !g, use something like !s instead.	
7477	 geekynerdynerd	 It's not. However because of duckduckgo's dedication to privacy and fighting against censorship regardless of content they've gained a cult-like following in alt right circles after Google began their crackdown on Nazis and alt righters. As we've seen repeatedly over the last year or so nuance is a dead art and people can't tell the difference between search engine choice and ideological learnings.

7490	 Bal_u	 Do not get a Nexus 5x, they have a common manufacturing defect that makes them die in an unrepairable way. If you're looking for something cheaper than the Pixel, the Moto G5+ has an unlockable bootloader and great community support.	
7491	 bw_raymond24	 I don't know of any books, but privacytools.io is a good source for tools to protect you.  The most important tools to protect you are a script blocker like uMatrix, an ad blocker like uOrigin, and common sense not to download untrusted files or open any untrusted emails. All scripts should be deny by default and only allowed if the site is trusted and the website won't work without it.Another tip I saw on r/linux was to have two accounts on your PC, an admin account and an account with no admin privilages. When you surf the web, only use the non-admin account.

7496	 tagawa	 Hi. There's a lot of overlap in functionality - /u/Tib5 makes some good points - and the point of our extension is to bring these various forms of privacy protection into a single package for ease of use, with some extra features such as a privacy grade for each website.

7500	 milesmcclane	 Ah ok- thanks for the advice! I used to use keepass touch, and minikeepass. But I upgraded my main database to a kdbx 4, and those apps don’t support that newer standard yet. That’s why I was looking at keeweb as a way of viewing it on iOS devices- it’s the only open source keepass app that can view the newer file type on iOS. As far as I know anyway! 	
7501	 435refdgdfg4treg	 You can go into settings and change your unique identifier on Google ads. I guess you can setup the Android phone with a throwaway account.	
7502	 LatticeCrypted	 Depends on which one, a lot of them are defined in /system/build.propSo you'd need to root and edit that file.Or get an app that makes editing that file easier, still need root though.

7505	 Harvey_Weinig	 Defeating "browser fingerprinting" is hard. Here's a tool that grades your browser configuration's uniqueness (fingerprint).It's made by a group that hasn't disappointed me yet (kinda love these guys): https://panopticlick.eff.org/Edit: i commented before reading - because stoopid... This is a really cool, informative tool. Thanks for sharing it.	
7506	 shifty_pete	 That may all be true. But if I were building a system where there were 3 searches done for “search term x” “search term x for sale” and “search term x location y” within a set period of time and there were hits on the top results for those search terms from the same IP, I could extrapolate with high confidence that those searches were done by that IP, the person is located at or near location y and they are looking to buy things related to search term x.

7509	 doozerdoozer	 I read in the thread regarding the release of DDG's add-on that privacy badger is useless because of a DNT header which basically identifies you. Any comment?	
7510	 andrewornot	 The iOS 11 security guide doesn't mention local storage, or dictation. Some things it *does* say about Siri:  &gt;"The recording of the user’s spoken words is sent to Apple’s voice recognition server. If the task involves dictation only, the recognized text is sent back to the device."  &gt;"When Siri is turned on, the device creates random identifiers for use with the voice recognition and Siri servers. These identifiers are used only within Siri and are utilized to improve the service. If Siri is subsequently turned off, the device will generate a new random identifier to be used if Siri is turned back on."  &gt;"Many Siri functions are accomplished by the device under the direction of the server. For example, if the user asks Siri to read an incoming message, the server simply tells the device to speak the contents of its unread messages."  I'm assuming that when you turn Siri and/or Dictation off, if there is any local storage, it's erased. Because when you turn those services back on you have to re-train them again. Edit: Also, when you go to iCloud storage settings, it says "Turn off Siri in iCloud and delete what Siri has learned."	
7511	 TrashMacNugget	 If you're using Tor Browser with scripts disabled, you're not really giving them a "click". Their analytics and advertisements won't load.	
7512	 [deleted]	 Don't forget though that if you are in America and your data is going overseas it's being picked up by not just American 702 FISA but host countries as well, Europe is just better at hiding how their NSA equivs do the same thing, so I suggest you keep your data inside the US because at least in theory you have the ability to call it a warrantless collection.	
7513	 wolftune	 That's largely true for scripts disabled with any browser given that most tracking uses JavaScript in practice today. But I get your point. I still have an intuition that the tradeoffs and effects would be different with a redirect to archived version of whatever…Obviously if everyone did this, it would effectively create a silo out of the archive site in a weird way. I can certainly see problems, especially with the pure bandwidth load for the archive site(s).	
7514	 ZaphodBeebblebrox	 If you use ublock, you could create a filter like `*$script` and `*$inline-script` and then go into the logger and enter `script` in the search bar. Then it would show you all of the scripts from a site that are being blocked and you can manually whitelist them as necessary. However, this sounds extremely painful and is probably not what you are looking for.Edit: For cookie managing purposes, there is an extension called [Edit This Cookie](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/editthiscookie/fngmhnnpilhplaeedifhccceomclgfbg) which allows you to block or allow cookies on a cookie by cookie basis	
7515	 Harvey_Weinig	 I don't know the answer, but hope someone does! You might checkout the chrome/Firefox add-on "cookie autodelete". In the settings menu it allows you to create what they term "expressions" which looks like a simple scripting tool for unique cases.

Then it go bloated and I switch to Phoenix, which later became Firefox. I missed those search options and the mouse gestures a lot, but what can you do...Fun fact. Opera also was the first to introduce tabbed browsing.	
7521	 optiontrader1138	 I've done a LOT of research on Privacy Badger. Have a stack of source code sitting on my desk right now.It may make you feel a little safer but it's doing very little. Essentially a combination of blocking third party cookies based on their domain frequency in conjunction with some simple entropy analysis.The thing is, third party cookies aren't really the problem anymore. Everyone in the ad/tracking industry counts on the fact that 40% of people are blocking them, so they've developed better ways.I don't get the comment about it making you easy to fingerprint. Would like some elaboration on that.tl;dr: Privacy Badger isn't doing shit for you.	
7522	 optiontrader1138	 There's not much entropy in having the DNT header set.	
7523	 mrcaptncrunch	 You can trigger bookmarks using keywords on Firefox. If you set Google’s to `g` You can then use `g abc` and it search google for `abc‘Make sure the bookmark is to `https://google.com/?q=%s``%s` is where `abc` will appear.

7527	 TM8O	 Brilliant!	
7528	 SecuritySquirrel	 I will assume you are in the US for my answer.If it is reloadable, a real SSN must be tied to the prepaid card by Federal Law.Also by Federal Law, you cannot use a US Prepaid Card with any merchant/processor outside of the US. This includes online and many online retailers are now blocking the BINs, card #s for the card, for prepaid cards so they don't have to deal with issues down the road.With that said, my personal favorite are the Vanilla Visa cards that are a one time load of $20-$500 with a onetime activation fee of $5.95. No fees after that. However, if you try and buy one for $500 or any amount of cards over $500, your going to get shit from the store.	
7529	 Zulban	 Thanks for the clear explanation.	
7530	 SecuritySquirrel	 You can, at some smaller banks, open a SDB in the name of an LLC with an EIN number and just have your name as a "key holder". For best results you would form the LLC and get the EIN but use neither for any other purpose. However, doing this would also increase your upfront cost and the annual cost of having the SDB like this. The benefit is that even Law Enforcement with a warrant would have a hard time finding the box since it is in neither your name or SSN.No one ever said Privacy was Cheap.	
7531	 wolftune	 Update: just for one-off links, I found several options including:* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/wayback-machine_new/* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/view-page-archive/* https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/get-archive/among others, so that's cool

7546	 CryptoxGEEK	 So that's intetesting... But is there a way to build a black box that effectively acts as a man-in-the-middle for either Alexa or Google so as to capture some of their responses and then commands to other local networked devices so that after a first response these devices can be used without connecting the Alexa or Google boxes to the Internet. I want to do some home automation but want to keep it all in-house. Sniff the traffic and build a local library than can run securely standalone. Thoughts?

7553	 akunbaru	 can we get the app to F-Droid App Store?	
7554	 No-User-Name	 There's already a huge thread on this but I'll post a comment here... I like the idea of this application, it's features and information it displays as in all in one privacy solution for a novice or perhaps even a immediate mobile user, but on desktop it simply can't contend with tools like the powerful uBlock Origin, with uBO-Scope and HTTPS Everywhere that together give you much more. for those novices on mobile I recommend this when the app has a bit more time to work out the kinks and get further optimized. I wanted to really like it but currently I'll wait for updates and see what DuckDuckGo does with something here that has much potential.

7562	 IsopropylWick	 Me too, it's easier to know someone trustworthy who made a local instance than to trust some guy who runs a company

7565	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
7566	 IsopropylWick	 Good reason to use a trustworthy searx instance to aggregate startpage ddg and qwant results isn't it ?	
7567	 Exaskryz	 But firefox has done tabbed browsing right. Pixel-wide tabs is not good, but that's what Chromium browsers do -- there's no scrolling tab bar. Only workarounds that exist are moving your tab bar to the side of your browser instead of the top and scrolling up and down -- if you want to read your tabs at all, you still need to take up a huge portion of your screen. Tab titles need to match the direction of scrolling; if I was reading Japanese, it'd be just fine to have my tabs on the side and scroll up and down.That is one huge barrier to moving to Vivaldi. The other is that you can't use addons like Quick Drag to click links of text, drag it a short distance, and open it in a background tab. The default behavior is to highlight the words of the hyperlink. You need to *perfectly* drag straight down or up to get it to work, otherwise you highlighted a d in [reddit](https://www.reddit.com) -- because people want to highlight partial links for copying?? ~~Edit: And when I'm on imgur and click and drag a thumbnail, it opens the thumbnail, and not the link. Because, that's desirable ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯~~ Edit 2: That's just the addon misbehaving, because it's not as good as Firefox's.	
7568	 IsopropylWick	 For the cookies this is when Firefox first party isolation comes into place, and you can block google analytics with unlock origin	
7569	 Neuromante	 All right, I'll check it out when I'm back at home, thanks!EDIT: Yeah, well, if instead of downvoting me for being polite someone could actually provide some resources, it would be super helpful.	
7570	 IsopropylWick	 You mean !r	
7571	 Skopjanecot	 I like their intentions and use their search engine, but the Android app just seems very slow. I'll just continue using Firefox Focus probably.	
7572	 econopl	 What's the point of using `!g` if it redirects you to Google? Is it any better than doing a Google search directly?	
7573	 Jzargos_Helper	 I use it because for the most part DDG is sufficient but I occasionally have a wordier or more specific search result that I know google can do better. It’s convenient basically but as someone else mentioned above we can achieve the same result by  using !s while also circumventing Google’s watchful eye.	
7574	 ABaseDePopopopop	 That's weird, especially since fighting for privacy and blocking tracking is more usually associated with left-wing circles, at least in Europe.	
7575	 IsThisTheRealLife	 This might be concerning to the dozens of people who care enough about privacy to avoid Google but somehow do not have an ad blocker.

7592	 86rd9t7ofy8pguh	 I'm not really good at explaining. Here's my 5 cent:1. XMPP is a communications protocol, the same way e-mail has its own protocol, e.g. [SMTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Mail_Transfer_Protocol).2. So, if you want to use XMPP, you need to register a new username, say from [xmpp dot is](https://xmpp.is/account/register/xmpp_is/) [you are not obligated to type your e-mail from that site].3. Then whatever username you've made, say blabla@xmpp.is (note, it's not an e-mail but XMPP), you can now login to any XMPP client.4. Whatever client you have downloaded, an Android app (be it Xabber or Conversations) or for Windows e.g. Tor Messenger ([xmpp.is have also a guide on how you can connect with it](https://xmpp.is/docs/connect/tor-messenger/how-to/)). So from the client, just type blabla@xmpp.is and the password... that's it.Just remember to press on the lock icon to encrypt your conversations. Both Xabber and Tor Messenger offer [OTR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-the-Record_Messaging) encryption. Though, they don't offer [OMEMO like Conversations app](https://conversations.im/omemo/) does.Hmm... I don't know about the link being broken. Have you added its repository into the F-Droid?

7601	 1093bcf14dui5	 I'd suggest using something open source such as Bitwarden. KeePass would probably be optimal, but I know how inconvenient and annyoing it is to type every website and then search for it, copy and paste all manually.	
7602	 Eucalyptuse	 I just meant you can !bang "Website Name" and find any bang you don't know.	
7603	 invisabit	 Can vouch for Bitwarden, saw it a year ago or so on reddit (the main dev is very active) and have loved it ever since. Great addon, great mobile app, can be self hosted, etc.	
7604	 astrobase_go	 I may be in the minority here, but I do think (given some caveats, for example that encryption is required both in motion and at rest) that this is a better solution than local storage. health records go for quite a bit of money on the darkweb, so poorly-defended databases are prime candidates for serious breach attempts. if that's the case, I would rather trust the security of those records to people paid a bunch of money at google or amazon to secure them, rather than an underpaid and overworked junior IT staffer. in this case, my health data being stolen and sold online is a more serious privacy concern than google doing something with it.	
7605	 akunbaru	 &gt; Bitwardeni still prefer KeePass"bitwarden won't pass due to non-free dependencies. There are important differences between an open source app and a free/libre and open source app."https://github.com/bitwarden/mobile/issues/6https://f-droid.org/wiki/page/Inclusion_Policy

7607	 astrobase_go	 in the interest of actually answering op's question, lastpass has had a [series](https://www.engadget.com/2017/03/22/critical-exploits-found-in-lastpass-on-chrome-firefox/) of [problems](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2016/07/27/lastpass-vulnerability-hacks/#3759f8af127c) with [security](https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/15/8785481/lastpass-security-notice-hack-password-manager) in the past. to be clear, people [aren't happy](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/evdbdz/why-security-experts-are-pissed-that-1password-is-pushing-users-to-the-cloud) that 1password apparently now stores passwords in the cloud, rather than a local vault, but I do think 1password seems a better option than lastpass.that said, I myself manage passwords through keepassx, store them locally, and use syncthing for p2p transfer between devices. it's a little onerous to set up, but I trust its security way more than cloud-based password managers.	
7608	 IsopropylWick	 Oh okay and !bangs for a full list	
7609	 1093bcf14dui5	 Yup, it seems like a good app. The only things scaring me off so far are lacks of security audits (dev was planning on having one a year ago but didn't for unknown reason) and the fact that there is only a single dev. But probably still a lot safer than LastPass.	
7610	 invisabit	 ~~Any iOS apps that can use KeePass files that have been updated in the past 6 months at least? That is where my problem lies - all of them haven't been updated in over a year or so (again, iOS only).~~I stand corrected!	
7611	 shakid211	 Ok fine, find a compatible Android phone with lineage os or another custom rom. Root it, unlock the bootloader, flash twrp recovery then install the rom, don't install gapps or any useful app from the play store, keep it updated ( hopefully an update won't break the os) becareful not to get hacked because most rooms are built for privacy not security, but aren't really private because Google still finds it's way into Android, at the end is it all worth it? Just buy an iPhone like the rest of the world. 	
7612	 f112809	 It really bothers me that if you change the default search engine in Chrome, you'll lose the default *Search Google for image* option in context menu when right clicking on an image, and you won't be able to get relevant search suggestions or do a [quick calculation](https://www.teq.com/teq-news/4-tips-to-become-a-google-chrome-omnibox-master/) from omnibox.	
7613	 1093bcf14dui5	 Sure, KeePass is probably as safe as it gets. It's also very annoying to use, and if convenience is important, then Bitwarden is likely the best choice imo.I realize it's very upsetting the dev included google analytics, but I'd be willing to bet my money LastPass and others do the same thing &amp; much more.

7615	 RobotQueue	 Don’t think so with voice, because everything after “Alexa” doesn’t get processed locally for speech recognition -it gets captured and sent to cloud services which do the more complex speech recognition, as well as semantic process8ng trying to figure out your intended meaning.  Doing that locally is a difficult project.

7622	 jawz101	 Pointing out old coding issues doesn't really say much to me.  They're more popular and people have scrutinized it more.	
7623	 invisabit	 You are correct, thank you for the update! I know last year when I had check (and went with Bitwarden), the apps had all seemed abandoned for iOS. 	
7624	 RootInTheRedHat	 Stop trolling 	
7625	 LinearActuator	 What irony. Removing the words "Honesty" and "Openness" from their core values makes the NSA more honest and open about the things that they do.	
7626	 txdm	 Anysoft Keyboard is safe to use, as far as I know. It is available via F-Droid	
7627	 astrobase_go	 sure, that's also a possibility for op. personally I just use keepassx because it's in the debian repos and I can offload management to the package manager.	
7628	 Monkey-sluts	 canary	
7629	 strugglz	 Hell I'm surprised those were core values to begin with.	
7630	 quote_work_unquote	 Hard to compare all the back-end stuff as to which one blocks trackers better, but surprisingly DDG actually blocks ads better than FireFox Focus. I visit a sports blog that has lots of obnoxious ads, and DDG seems to block 100% of them like Brave and Firefox with uBlock origin do. Focus lets in like 10% of the ads for some reason. Focus had the edge in the fact that it has tabs and and the ability to open in other browsers. DDG is strictly a one-tab browser with almost no settings at the moment.

7636	 deegwaren	 &gt; vivaldi has a pretty neat trick where you can just search the letter s with a space after it and then the search term to open startpage or whatever elseFirefox can too, just right-click into a textfield of a search form and click on the context menu item called "Add a Keyword for this Search" after which you will be prompted to make a bookmark having a keyword and a parametrised location URL for you to use just like the quick searches you talk about.

7642	 Tib5	 In regards to the DNT Header, that actually is a pretty good point, but only really matters if:* You want to completely "Whitelist" a website.* You don't have another blocker, such as Ublock Origin or DDG Essentials.Reason being, is even if the tracking/ad agency is tracking the DNT, Privacy Badger should stop them. However, if the EFF deems that ad/tracking agency complies to certain guidelines they will allow the it, that's where the second blocker comes in and stops that. Yes, it would be nice to stop the header, but even certain browsers (firefox) no longer allow you to disable it if you use addons that help protect you online.

7646	 DigitalMindShadow	 Somehow it seems plausible that the NSA would be capable of doing something as absurd and counterproductive as sending themselves a gag order.	
7647	 bigfig	 I came here to say that.  I mean, if you ask someone "Can I trust you with a secret?" and they answer "no, not really" maybe they are doing you a favor?

7652	 AnDeargDoom	 Could use a trezor. It sends your logins to dropbox, with each login encrypted separately. It only works on chrome..for me anyway.Of course you could also get a yubikey	
7653	 Exaskryz	 There is in FF. Just set minimum tab width to 1.I cannot stand not reading my tab names. I can barely toletate not being able yo close backkground tabs with a single click - hovering over a tab in chrome/vivaldi does not give you an x button unless it is the active tab.	
7654	 ipev	 Yes. Microsoft Office is updated from Windows Update. Yes. You'll need a more sophisticated firewall to see network connections by processes.In case you're using Windows Firewall, temporarily enable both inbound and outbound connections for the office program to download templates. 	
7655	 extrapulp23	 I appreciate the transparency	
7656	 ForestOfCheem	 Tech/data miners/websites have become like banks, lawyers, and insurance companies: they take advantage of people, especially those who are uneducated, typically minorities and immigrants, and hide behind the dense legalese of a contract or TOS agreement.

7658	 USAisDyingLOL	 Anyone going to get started on dismantling this obviously corrupt and unconstitutional agency?Didn't think so...	
7659	 sneakysneaky1010	 never trust 3rd party encryption, always use pgp.. it takes less then 2 mins to send a basically non-dycryptable message.	
7660	 StefanJanoski	 Oh excellent. It's not quite the same as the way Chrome handles them because even at a minimum size of 1, there's still some scrolling (perhaps there is some internal minimum which they won't shrink beyond) but it's an improvement, so thanks for the tip.Regarding closing tabs, Chrome and FF seem the same to me. Background tabs have a close button, but it's removed once they get too small.Of course, if you're using a mouse and not a trackpad or something else then middle click is the easiest way.	
7661	 RenaKunisaki	 Could the president issue one to them?	
7662	 ld2gj	 What their sites says now: &gt; Core Values &gt;Commitment to Service - Knowing that the country, our friends and allies are relying on us, we are dedicated to fulfilling our commitment to serve and to excellence in the pursuit of our critical mission.    &gt;Respect for the Law - Everything we undertake in our missions is grounded in our adherence to the U.S. Constitution and compliance with the U.S. laws, regulations and policies that govern our activities.&gt;Integrity - We are committed to communicating honestly and directly, acting ethically and fairly and carrying out our mission efficiently and effectively.    &gt;Transparency - We are committed to fostering public understanding of NSA's mission and to providing complete transparency to those who authorize and oversee NSA's work on behalf of the American people. &gt;Respect for People - We are committed to ensuring that all NSA personnel are respected, included and valued for their diverse backgrounds, experiences, skills and contributions to our mission and culture.    &gt;Accountability - We are accountable for our actions and take responsibility for our decisions, practicing wise stewardship of public resources and placing prudent judgment over expediency.Yea, still looks like they are full of shit to me. 	
7663	 sneakysneaky1010	 libreoffice is free, and opensource... by default it saves files in .odt format, which is compatable with word and most other text editing programs.	
7664	 NakedTonyDanza	 Not if they're snooping through your shit looking for the secret anyway.	
7665	 tywkeene	 Just like Comcast when they changed their net neutrality promise right as it was repealed.I hate to sound like a doomsayer but it feels like things are going to shit a lot more rapidly lately.

If you work for the NSA and do not prioritize upholding the Constitution above all else, you are a bad guy.N.B.: Private tortured interpretation​s of the Constitution to suit your whims **do not count**.  The NSA is not qualified nor can a democracy survive under such Orwellian double standards.	
7667	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
7668	 Mikerinokappachino	 Openness wasn't even one of the original core values. If you look at the article it has a link to the way back machine archive where it never had Openness as a core value. Title is certainly misleading.Also they changed their description on their core value Integrity to include honesty, which was conveniently left out. It seems they wanted to just combine honesty and integrity, which are pretty much the same thing anyway.All in all this is pretty fucking meaningless evidence as I doubt somebody at the NSA decided that they are going to remove honesty from the core values that way everyone knows they can now be dishonest.	
7669	 metaaxis	 They didn't assert they *wouldn't* be open and honest.I mean, do you really trust the guy who has to say, "trust me!"

7686	 Infinitopolis	 Anyone else think the NSA would benefit from just admitting its a hacking organization? I feel that this function of the government would be best served if it bragged about screwing with our enemies online. I know this would be the cyber policy version of kicking a hornets nest...but when all we really hear about are domestic NSA issues it devalues any good work that *is* performed.This would offset the creeping sentiment that countries like China and Russia can have their way with us online.Feel free to point out how wrong I am.

7688	 rojanofkevlar	 Sounds like respect for people ends at their employees 	
7689	 Rifleshoot	 At least they are being more honest and open about they’re honesty and openness!  That said, I don’t think honestly and openness is what we are looking for in a spy organization anyways.  They can give us their focus group tested lines to make us feel better or they can just do what they were formed to do.  There should be an unaffiliated oversight group that monitors all NSA/CIA activity though.

If you actually check the before and after, they simply remove `Honesty` as the name of one of the points, but changed `Integrity` to this:&gt;We are committed to communicating honestly and directly, acting ethically and fairly and carrying out our mission efficiently and effectively.Comes back to the same thing (even if they won't follow it).	
7696	 torku	 Because you say family plan I assume you have other besides yourself? In that case I would go with 1Password. They are excellent. Not open source and your password are stored in the cloud but everything is encrypted locally. If it’s just you and you are using Windows the I would go with keepass all the way. I would never use Windows but if I had to keepass would be the one reason I would actually enjoy it. I hate the OSX and Kinux ports but love the original windows version.  For families though I recommend 1pasword.

7752	 CryptoxGEEK	 Looking to operate local items; lights, hvac, drapes, vents, sound, etc. But I do not want a central system outside of my house doing the command and control. My thinking is if I can replay the same commands sent over the local network from afar, then I can run in a secure mode. There will only be a limited set of responses for any given site that could be mimiced. A custom PC would manage the home.The old BSR X-10 systems would sometimes issue duplicate comands, ON, ON, OFF, OFF and you would never notice it. The tech back then as a bit flaky and with the possibility of a non received command it was needed. Most noticed with relay devices that would "click" multiple times as the relay cycled a couple duplicate commands.I would only use Alexa or Google responses to retrieve the inbound commands, then store for reuse. But since there is no local processing I still have an issue accepting each voice command, although not so much replaying specific actions. So back to looking for alternatives.I am sure there is a demand for this sort of a private limited command/response system in response to privacy concerns. Then also so you still have a working smart house when the Internet is down for some reason.Need an Alexa or Google in a box for home basics.

We will be truthful with each other, and honor the public's need for openness, balanced against national security interests.Openness is right there. Unchanged from August 1 2016 till this new update when the honesty section was removed all together. Besides that since when is the metric whatever is "original". If something valuable is added, and then subsequently removed, the fact it wasn't "original" doesn't make it less important. It's a strawman argument.

7788	 btcltcbch	 I think that their main goal is to keep the USA as an economic leader.... nothing about terrorists (that's just a pretext).	
7789	 CharadeParade__	 They do admit they are a hacking organization. I was at a conference a couple years ago and heard a speech by Rob Joyce, who at the time lead Tailored Access Operations, which is literally NSAs elite offensive cyber operations unit. He was speaking about nation state cyber operations, how to engineer them and how to prevent them. It was pretty neat, he said "this is how you are vulnerable to us, and here's how to protect yourself." a really interesting bit was what he said about Steam. Steam is apparently a huge in for NSA when it comes to gaining access to networks. Find some kid who has steam installed on his dad's work laptop, compromise the account, wait till dad connects to the network at work, and your in. Obviosuly not that simple but I'm paraphrasing. It was a public conference I'm sure it's in YouTube.

The title makes it seem like Honesty and Openness are 2 separate core values that were both removed, you can't really be trying to argue that is the case right?&gt; Besides that since when is the metric whatever is "original". If something valuable is added, and then subsequently removed, the fact it wasn't "original" doesn't make it less important. It's a strawman argument.What? I tried reading this 10 times and couldn't make out what you are talking about. Are you trying to say that all of the descriptors under the core value 'Honesty' are actually core values themselves?If thats the case then the new web page under the 'Integrity' core value has honesty listed in there:&gt; Integrity - We are committed to communicating **honestly** and directly, acting ethically and fairly and carrying out our mission efficiently and effectively.If you are being intellectually honest then you must admit that 'Honesty' was never removed then.

7803	 thibaultmartin	 Hello,Apologies if I broke any rule of this thread. I didn't mean to make any promotion, but genuinely thought that people in this thread might be interested in the progress of an Android-free and iOS-free phone.Purism, the company behind the phone already has rolled out its Librem laptops, along with PureOS (an FSF-endorsed linux distribution) and often puts an emphasis on how privacy is important.While I do believe this news can be of interest for many of the people browsing /r/privacy, it still is up to you to remove it if you do not consider it worth reading :)	
7804	 thibaultmartin	 &gt; I'm concerned about lack of support for SignalCopperhead already release Noise, a free implementation of Signal (without GMC). I do believe there will be unofficial Signal clients. PureOS is just a Linux distribution after all :)&gt; or other privacy related appsWhich one do you think you will be missing? Firefox will be available, along with its many privacy-enhancing extensions. As a full Linux OS, you will have a full firewall, the ability to mount a VPN, and much more. Actually it is much less limited than an Android phone.

7809	 1093bcf14dui5	 Protonmail wants phone verification when registering through TOR. My vote goes to Tutanota which allows TOR, but you can't use the email for 2 days after registering.	
7810	 86rd9t7ofy8pguh	 I like this [comment](https://blog.torproject.org/comment/273512#comment-273512):Mozilla has destroyed their browser and you seem to act as if it's no problem. Webextensions fundamentally does not work with a hardened, locked down browser. If you harden in about:config and disable javascript APIs, extensions lose access to these APIs as well, meaning if you need certain security tools to have access to these APIs there is no way unless the browser is fundamentally redesigned to prevent javascript that is run (not that I would recommend running any) by third party sites from also accessing these APIs. Separate javascript contexts must be set up such that specific APIs can be enabled for each extension as necessary, and then the old setup of having as many APIs disabled as possible can be maintained for the 3rd party site context. If someone were being ambitious, a system that intercepted API calls in each of these contexts and listed requested APIs and allowed the user to selectively allow/deny specific calls for the browser session or permanently, etc would be great. However, the chances of anything like that appearing are zero.Mozilla every day makes their browser more and more dumbed down. I ask both Mozilla and TorProject to please stop the PR and focus on power users, the only users you have left who care about you at all, instead of promoting the incompetent, clueless users which Silicon Valley has managed to churn out worldwide. Perhaps if you focused on power users, we'd have less "regular users"!Mozilla keeps whitewashing core issues, adding intrusive bloat/spyware and entertaining the ignorant userbase with more nonsense, while in the background they neuter and reduce configurability of their browser often without discussion, and destroy the tiny bit left of their competent userbase. The main thing Firefox had over Chromium was its configurability and ability to be manually yet practically hardened according to a power user's needs, which only Chromium's developers historically reacted to with hostility, but now it would seem that same culture of hostility has infected Mozilla, which alongside their incompetence is a great mix. What a shame. Using the argument of "security" is laughable at best. Yes the old extension systems had core security issues. However, I really don't see how webextensions has really solved this. In fact that it relies on the same javascript engine as third party websites in some ways it has actually reduced security. The main thing that was needed was isolation, removal of bloat, permissions system that controlled API access, etc. Webextensions brings little of value and actually makes the browser more exploitable in certain scenarios.I hope the TorProject does not let itself be entirely compromised since it relies on Mozilla for a browser, and instead voices these issues, because otherwise frankly TorBrowser will be just as dead as Firefox, which would be a shame.So please TorProject, avoid the PR and nonsense, focus on securing your browser and making it practical/configurable for power users instead of wasting all your time on a userbase that are already too far gone to save.

7820	 btcltcbch	 For them, it might be ok to not be honest to other countries and such, but when you lie to congress and get away with it, there is something really wrong	
7821	 GrabEmbytheMAGA	 They just lost crucial information. FBI just lost information. So strange. 	
7822	 Rafficer	 That's not how 2FA works. There shouldn't be any push notifications.	
7823	 Skopjanecot	 Firefox Focus	
7824	 GnarlyBellyButton87	 Crow.Fuck your contextless bird names.	
7825	 bitb0y	 Google Authenticator as well as LastPass authenticator both have push notifications https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7026266?co=GENIE.Platform%3DiOS&amp;hl=en	
7826	 Arinde	 Not like those words meant anything to begin with.	
7827	 bitb0y	 Authy apparently does too, I just can't seem to get them working:https://authy.com/blog/authy-onetouch-modern-authentication-for-any-application/	
7828	 ScoopDat	 Pathetic	
7829	 Rafficer	 And with privacy in mind, that isn't really great. They all see when you try to log in and then send a code to your phone. Therefore the websites where this works have to be connected to your authy account. Lastpass sees when you access passwords and sends you 2fa then.	
7830	 textwolf	 All the major social media and silicon valley tech companies in the US (google, facebook, twitter, reddit, etc) have ridiculous left wing biases in their staff compared to the general population and have a history of censorship/demonitization of lots of stuff that isn't left wing/establishment media. The huge majority of authoritarian censorship of speech occurring in the US is against right wingers, by leftist dominated corporations. Whether they are doing it to try to be more "PC" for advertisers or because they ideologically oppose those who they censor is up for debate, but the censorship does occur and it hits hardest those who are right of center.	
7831	 bitb0y	 I'm not getting what you're saying. Lastpass didn't give me an option to have push notifications or not unless I universally turned off notifications for that app. I didn't have the option within the app. Also, LastPass authenticator doesn't require you to make an account. 	
7832	 whygodwhy11	 Nope, just smarter than some, and probably you	
7833	 Rafficer	 Tell me, how could an app know when you need which password? 	
7834	 fuck_the_amish137	 Too bad its a Metal Gear Solid 3 reference👍🏻 	
7835	 anejole	 Well yeah, the thing is it's an unknown right now if Signal will be ported by someone or not and I rely pretty heavily on it currently.I guess if I'm able to install any .deb package then I should be alright for most of the rest of it. Curious what the navigation situation will be. Not like I use that a ton but it would be nice to have a good navigation app that takes current traffic into consideration.Edit: I'm an idiot. There's a signal icon on the mockup. Guess it'll be there.	
7836	 anejole	 Well I'm glad you posted it. I'm looking forward to seeing how this phone turns out.	
7837	 bitb0y	 When you initially download the app, you click the + sign to add a new service for 2FA, then it asks you to scan the QR code that's on the website of whatever service you're trying to add. Once you scan, the website asks you to confirm the code that now appears on your authenticator app. From that point, push notifications are on for whatever services offer them unless you go into the main iPhone settings and universally turn off notifications for LastPass authenticator. 	
7838	 lankist	 I can't tell you how many of my coworkers have been like "can you keep a secret?" and I'm like "no," and then they tell me anyway.	
7839	 Rafficer	 Now you told me how they how to add a password. But how does the app know when you logged in to google and sends you exactly this password? For that, the app needs to have a confirmation from outside that it's added, which is not standard with 2FA. And if you just add the secret, nobody can know. And therefore you won't have notifications. 	
7840	 TheJackalope231	 I think we should hear them out- there's at least a grain of truth in what /u/Five2for6 said and I think that's worth enough to hear more.	
7841	 Kenhamsbible	 This canary is dead.	
7842	 bitb0y	 Download it and try it yourself. What I explained above is exactly how to set up 2FA w/ push notifications via LastPass authenticator.	
7843	 Kenhamsbible	 The rotting pile that remains of it has been incinerated now.	
7844	 talynone	 lol, get some fresh air dude, you're pretty wound up.	
7845	 Infinitopolis	 I would argue that their targets are "enemies". Realistically, economic opponents *are* more dangerous to the administration than terrorism...and I use 'administration' on purpose. The civil servants working at NSA might care about the nation, but the agency as a macro-entity works to protect the executive.	
7846	 Infinitopolis	 That makes sense. If one searches they will find that link.I suppose I am speaking more to those who only go wiki deep and compare that to what they hear in media.	
7847	 AKA_Wildcard	 Well at least they’re being &amp;lt;redacted&gt; about it	
7848	 TerryOller	 They could have just removed "openness" and then kept "honesty".	
7849	 CharadeParade__	 [Here's an article about said speech] (https://www.google.ca/amp/s/www.wired.com/2016/01/nsa-hacker-chief-explains-how-to-keep-him-out-of-your-system/amp) 	
7850	 GracchiBros	 &gt; They must think Americans are morons.They are correct and they more than anyone else know it.	
7851	 Rafficer	 Done. Added a 2FA code, logged in to the service I used and as expected, I did not receive a push notification... Well, how should they know? 	
7852	 cutzer243	 Well at least they're being open and not lying to us anymore.	
7853	 bitb0y	 I'm not really sure, but I know that definitely for Amazon as well as LastPass itself (logging into the website) both sent push notifications. But also, I'm not sure why we're having a convo about whether or not LastPass authenticator has push notifications, when I've already posted a link that discusses it. Here is another link: https://blog.lastpass.com/2016/03/lastpass-authenticator-makes-two-factor-easy.html/I posted here looking for help with Authy, can you help me with that?	
7854	 Jonathan_Sessions	 A hero is part-human and part-supernatural. A hero is born out of a childhood trauma, or out of a disaster that must be avenged.	
7855	 lugh	 removed, not a privacy issue	
7856	 Rafficer	 What I'm trying to say is, for a push notification, the service you log in to must know that you are using that exact phone with that exact app. If you don't tell that to Authy, they won't send you push notifications. The app doesn't know when you access your account. And for that to work, both authy and the service have to support each other, which I doubt for most services.	
7857	 via_the_blogosphere	 They also added a bunch of new bullets, which the article doesn’t seem to acknowledge.  To think this page changing means anything about how NSA operates is silly.

7863	 thibaultmartin	 &gt; I guess if I'm able to install any .deb package then I should be alright for most of the rest of it. PureOS is based on debian, and the phone is meant to be able to run any Linux distribution (though I concede PureOS will probably the most suited for a phone, at least at launch)&gt; Edit: I'm an idiot. There's a signal icon on the mockup. Guess it'll be there.I don't think it is trustworthy. The mockup was community made, and the designer agreed that Purism would use it for their campain. Purism actually partnered up with Matrix.org for the integrated IM.I highly doubt that Signal will ever be ported by m0xie, its creator. It was already a huge pain to make him implement a GCM free version of Signal, and he is very hostile to unofficial ports of Signal.Someone *could* actually implement a Signal client, but I don't think Purism will take responsability for it as a company.

7867	 ItsInTheOtherHand	 &gt;And they should be shut down during a shutdown. The NSA is not essential to the functioning of the nation.I have as many issues with what the NSA does and hate mass surveillance as much as the next guy, but this is an *incredibly* dumb statement. - The NSA  (as well as the other high level  intel agencies) have ongoing operations, sometimes years in the making, that can't just be "turned off" and on again.- Despite the (usually rightful) hate the NSA gets on this sub, it *does* perform critical functions to the security of the nation. It's because of the NSA and CIA, etc that airport security can have a 90% *failure* rate, but we still haven't had another major attack since 9/11. Not to mention rival nation states.

7869	 SaltyBundle	 I recently learned that the NSA does not have to operate under laws and regulations of the United States as it was created as an “urgent action”. Meaning they don’t have to file any financial reports or anything. So they can essentially do whatever the fuck they want.

7884	 Tibbitts	 You make this statement: "Openness wasn't even one of the original core values." First of all, that statement isn't true. It was in the original core values.Second, the argument is a strawman in the first place. Whether or not "openness" was on the original version of the page published does not matter. You are using how old the statement is as evidence of whether or not it matters that it was removed.On your final point, changing a value from being a main tenet to a description of a new tenet is a significant change. Fundamentally, this new version is less clear and bold. I think the overall point that this is a change that makes the values of the NSA less clear and specific. I think that is true. That is a real change.

7887	 towawaylolbuttz	 It's called mobile device management. This is just an offering that Microsoft has. There are plenty of MDM offerings from VMWare, SolarWinds, IBM, Google,  your phone carriers, and a lot of others. All Android and iOS devices have MDM features just waiting to be flipped on.You probably haven't heard an outcry because this is something businesses use to protect their IP/information on phones. When I have deployed a MDM solution, I had big brother mode for all company owned phones, and a lighter set of features for employee owned. That was just my personal choice, though. Even adding a business Google account or Exchange account to your phone gives the administrator privileges to remotely wipe your phone.	
7888	 senicrun	 You could get a cheap secondary phone for company use, or just go without the email on your phone if you really don't trust your IT dept.

7911	 No-User-Name	 I'm assuming you're talking about (DuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials)... the others you mentioned are specifically made with many more options to a dedicated function where as DuckDuckGo's extension/app is a more convenient all in one privacy solution aimed at more novice users. if you're looking for a good balance I'd say uBlock Origin with HTTPS Everywhere is an excellent choice. 	
7912	 SamSibbens	 Steam == no network in which I ever connected to is safe?This reminds me of the Notepad++ update that said they updated/replaced a program that was now known to be used by the FBI or NSA or something.	
7913	 FatherGascoigne	 It's recognized and shows up, and shows how much space is left on it, and even says it's healthy.  But when formatting through Disk Manager, it says "The Format Did Not Complete Successfully."  When I plug it in Windows even tells me it's messed up, but that it can't repair it.That's why I'm wondering what programs I can use to try a workaround.	
7914	 CharadeParade__	 Well, sadly, no network is safe when NSA wants access to it. There's only various access points with different levels of ease. 	
7915	 No-User-Name	 It's basically redundant with those extensions you mention, the only real functionally you'd need to cover at this point from DuckDuckGo's new extension/app can be had with uBO-Scope for getting a graph layout on third party domain percentages per sites visited.https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ubo-scope/

7956	 greeklemoncake	 If you legitimately want context, a canary in this sense refers to a line in a company's core values whose only purpose is to indicate that something has been changed which can't be disclosed directly to the public - much in the same sense that a canary in a coal mine will tell you something is wrong when it dies. An example is a company whose mission statement includes "We will never give your private information to third-party entities or governments." If the company is then forced to give information to the government but is also forced by that government to not disclose that the handover has happened, it can remove the canary so the public can then deduce what has happened, while the company is still in compliance with the government's orders.Fwiw I agree it's kind of lazy that OP to just say one word and expect everyone to know what they meant.	
7957	 aintgottimeforbs7	 Well, in this case they were tasked by Obama’s DOJ to help HRC and to go after Trump.  It was Obama that shared the dossier with Congress.  The FBI didn’t act independently.	
7958	 duffmanhb	 It technically is. Scotus approved their practices. The argument is that the constitution is not a suicide pact and sometimes rights can be infringed so long as A) it is necessary to uphold critical State functions and B) reasonably measures or alternatives are put in place Take for example free speech... By posting a huge billboard of your half naked wife right next to a school. The courts would say yeah A) the state is reasonable to protect children from such shocking forms of speech, but B) the state has to allow it to exist some place more reasonable like downtown around the bars and not just outcastes to the middle of the dessert. This form of speech is more accepted there. Let’s try another... protest march on a highway. A) the government needs to protect the safety and economic commerce of the community so it can restrict that speech so long as B) it gives them a viable alternative like downtown, the capital building, or popular park, but not some place outcasted like a small remote park with little social impact. It has to be relocated to a reasonable place. So in this case scotus argues that A) in today’s modern age this sort of surveillance is necessary and incredibly valuable for our intelligence efforts so B) it’s excepted so long as the government doesn’t do it haphazardly. So long as they are making every reasonable effort to protect that intel like adding layers and layers of safeguards, oversight, and protections it can be allowed. It also has to be specific with its use. This wouldn’t be the case if they just kept an open unencrypted database anyone there can access for any reason. I don’t like it so don’t shoot the messenger. I’m just explaining the logic behind how it’s technically okay.

7963	 CptHammer_	 When I was in the Navy my job took me to a position of needing secret clearance. I honestly liked what I had been doing so I wasn't interested in the prestige of working in the secret sector of my same job. I figured I would just answer the questions honestly and see where it went.First question after the verification questions (name, duty station, rank, etc.) was: Can't you keep a secret?I said, "no".The questions went on for about ten minutes all yes/no questions. A couple weeks later they gave me clearance.Now my dad was in transportation for the Army. He had Top Secret clearance for a while. I told him I said no to the big question. He laughed, told me that from that point on everything I would see would either be declassified already, or intentional disinformation. Like they need people to talk about "secret" stuff that is fake, or wrong. After a couple of months in the new department, I really felt like that was the case. On the downside, they know what I've been shown and even if it is fake, I can get in trouble for telling. Like they want me to tell, but they also have to make examples of snitches. I can honestly say this: I never saw anything that would be useful for day to day life.

7983	 SrewolfA	 I live a few minutes from fort Meade where NSA is and know plenty of people that work there. Some of them are a bit loopy from working there forever but I’ve never met an unpleasant person that said they worked at Meade or NSA.People like to paint those employees as monsters but every one of them I know has always been upstanding in my eyes. Not every job there has to do with spying on people. 	
7984	 ItsInTheOtherHand	 Do you really think *I* would know anything about the specific operations of the NSA, and of I did I would share them? If you *really* don't see how the NSA has prevented terrorist attacks, then I suggest your remove your tinfoil hat, because it's clouding your vision. The NSA: - Monitors communications traffic between suspected parties, and has probably uncovered terror plots when they were just in the planning stages, even before s bomb was built/the attacker trained/the guys even left Riyadh, etc.- *Countless* times it has probably used Sigint intercepts to provided location data for high ranking Taliban/AQ members so that Seals/Delta/RRD could execute a kill/capture mission, or a drone strike.- The fact that it is thoroughly monitoring hotspots, and that terrorists *know this* forces them to go to extreme length to keep their communications secret, which further hampers their ability to plan attack.Look, I am *eternally* skeptical of the government, and I am deeply concerned about the effect that mass surveillance can have on freedom *within our boarders*, but the idea that the CIA/NSA/DIA, etc has not stopped *any* attacks is frankly *insane*. The terrorist didn't stop trying in September 12, 2001, and it sure as hell isn't the TSA that's held them in check. Yes, the NSA absolutely needs more *oversight and accountability*, and it could probably be argued that *certain programs* might have little or effect - but the *sum of its activity* absolutely stops attacks. This is evident to any mildly rational person who isn't extremely biased or naive."Stopping and attack" doesn't mean some agents swooping in at the last minute to make some dramatic arrest. It also includes the thousands of small and routine actions these agencies carry out every day (monitoring, IDing, analysis, etc) - and by that measure they *absolutely* protect us from our enemies who seek to do us harm. The NSA might not be your "friend", but the world is a dangerous fucking place. It not like if we just "stopped the government spying on us" everything would be peaches and cream.	
7985	 Spacedude2169	 Ya, it seems like they're saying, "you spy on other but we don't spy on you"	
7986	 declaim	 Come on, they’re an intelligence agency. It was absurd for them to ever put those words there to begin with.You can hate them all you want, I won’t argue. But it’s absurd to think that a spy agency should be open and honest.	
7987	 btcltcbch	 I agree, but they do need some oversight (lying to congress doesnt help)	
7988	 ItsInTheOtherHand	 Perhaps. Though, it's kind of hard to know whose side Comey was on, he generally just seemed to be wanting to cover his ass* both ways.I think that around the time of the election  (and maybe even now) there were significant differences in opinion between the high-level, political leadership in the FBI and the mid-level/rank and file agents. I mean, I'm not a committed conspiracy theorist, but you do hear rumors of the "Intelligence War" supposedly going on between the two factions in the Alphabet Agencies.

7997	 DublinBen	 You should be submitting all assignments as a PDF anyway, to ensure that it looks exactly how you intend.  There are just as many formatting issues between different versions of Word as there are from LibreOffice.	
7998	 LinearActuator	 Your entire argument are things that you reckon they might have done. You're asking me to accept claims when there is literally no evidence to support them.There is plenty of evidence of the NSA undermining the security of the nation. How many times has news come out about the NSA trying or succeeding in creating backdoors and vulnerabilities in security systems used by Americans. Or the fact that the NSA finds vulnerabilities in software that they stockpile instead of responsibly disclosing to the vendors. Which leads to cybercriminals using those tools against Americans, which would not have happened if the NSA did not exist.There is clear evidence of the NSA's actions making the nation less secure. You've admitted there is literally no evidence to the contrary. The NSA has only existed for 65 years. The US has existed for 229 years. Which means the nation got on just fine for the last 164 years without the NSA. Clearly would have no problem continuing without them.

8004	 TheGoldenGoose8888	 I see little merit in using Android if you cant root. The biggest benefits for me come with freedom of being able to root. Its important security trade off but its why I do not really see much value personally in Copperhead. That being said, I use a Nexus 6P w/ Mike Perry’s mission improbable scripts which heavily customizes Copperhead and has root. Its a daily grind with this setup always problems but if your adventerous check it out it can be a sweet setup if you willing invest time into it. With respect to Android vs iOS. This is no argument. Its fact. iOS offer significantly superior security than android counterpart. This fact is objectively represented in the market price for 0day exploits for each platform. iOS fetching 20x to 30x higher than Android counterpart. But how Apple wins my admiration and respect is because the often underreported and overlooked benefit of secure enclave chip which hard coded from factory allows iOS software AND hardware to be DFU reset (software, firmware, baseband, etc) to cryptographically verified state. Mind blowing to see this type of tech on non-DOD kit. I never seen anything like it on consumer device before.

They are another arm of the US corrupt campaign to say anything, do anything to try to achieve and maintain their goal of world dominance.  They know and understand that their grip on holding on to the top spot is tenuous and slipping and when you are on top of the pile, there is only one way to go!  Further, there are large and growing countries who are emerging powerhouses in their own right, from organic growth and power who DO NOT share the US core values and they are challenging the historical US dominance, and the US doesn't like it.  Thucydidies trap is active and a reality.  Stand by for war.

8018	 FeatheryAsshole	 well, someone has to build the spying tools or process the spies' payment records.it's rather silly to expect all people who are involved in evil doings to be comic book villains - even Hitler was just some dude who liked dogs when he wasn't ranting about jews and whatnot, and the same goes tenfold for most nazi soldiers and nazi clerks.In fact, it's dangerous to paint them as comic book villains - that way, people end up thinking that no "normal" or "nice" person can commit evil.

8028	 JBits001	 Did they give a reason why?   They are both subjective terms, but don't be evil seems to have clearer intent than do the right thing.  The right thing for *whom*, the company, the customers, society?  There may be some competing priorities there.  The latter seems easier to defend in a lawsuit and maybe that was their logic.  No intentional nefarious purpose, other than to resduce liability as lawyers love to analyze the meaning and intent behind every word (dealt with too many red lined terms of conditions in my lifetime)	
8029	 duffmanhb	 Don’t bore yourself with this link but this is where they base their rational from founding fathers understanding of the constitution https://biotech.law.lsu.edu/cases/pp/MENDOZA-MARTINEZ.htmBasically the constitution is not a death pact. In the NSA case the spirit of the constitution is still upheld. While rights are being infringed it’s doing so in a very careful way and out of practical necessity. I’m a sophisticated digital age more advanced tools have to be used and deployed to combat and compete at this new level of intelligence gathering. The NSA isn’t — at least not supposed to — using this information for things like criminal investigations and political activities rather intelligence gathering related to national security. Like discovering spy networks, terrorist networks, and general espionage and intelligence gathering for critical needs. The nsa also goes great lengths to make accommodations to still protect the spirit and prevent abuse. Most people don’t know how the process works but it generally goes like this. The NSA saves everything and encrypts it all. It can never be accessed without approval. The idea is that it’s only saved so they can go back in time and look into suspected people. And since it’s encrypted they can’t go back in time except if this person has good reason to do so. Then with permission and oversight that individuals information narrowly pertaining to their investigation needs has their stuff decrypted. Then that stuff is looked through by an agent who has no understanding or knowledge of the case and it’s further broken up so no single person knows too much about it. Their job is to specifically vet the information to ensure the only stuff to be accessed is directly related to the case at hand. They even ensure names and identifying information is coded and labeled to prevent the next layer of agents know even less. It’s broken up in a way that every agent looking into it has no idea what’s going on. And the only way to get the big picture is if several of these unrelated agents communicated with each other to unmask the information and figure it out. After that it’s then reviewed by a specialist who also doesn’t know much and looks into what parts can go up the next chain as it relates to the specific inquiry. Until it finally reaches the other parts in the layers. They go great lengths — at least supposed to — to protect the contents at all levels. They are indeed infringing the written rule of the constitution they are taking beyond reasonable measures to protect individual rights as possible. It’s allowed because the practice is recognized as being tremendously critical in a modern technological and fast moving era. The lengths they go protect them and display they are still holding up to the spirit. A violation of the spirit of the law would mean they just did sweeping collection with unrestricted access for any reason and purpose at all.

8039	 trai_dep	 &gt;In the ad, actors playing Burger King employees taunt “actual guests” by making them wait for absurd amounts of time to receive their food — unless they pay huge tolls to get it quickly.&gt;But there’s a surprising amount of nuance in Burger King’s joke. When explaining the Whopper fast lane system to a customer, a cashier says that “Burger King corporation believes that they can sell more and make more money selling chicken sandwiches and chicken fries, so now they’re slowing down the access to the Whopper.” That resembles the real conflict of interest at the heart of the net neutrality debate: ISPs are often trying to sell things that compete with each other, and they have good reasons to try to steer customers toward the content that will make them more money. The danger of a world without net neutrality is that ISPs that sell cable television or their own streaming TV services will carve up the internet to push customers toward the services that make them more money.Click thru for more, including the video.

With this setup, you can properly remove the battery at night or whenever you absolutely don't need to use your phone.  You can also keep the phone in a pouch most of the day.  The removable battery actually guarantees your phone is turned off.

8043	 duffmanhb	 Well they definitely do it this way. After having to go to court a lot they know they are under a microscope now. They are lucky the courts have given them a legal pass for their shit which is why they did sweeping reforms both willingly and through Obama orders to go further than needed just to be safe. They know they are just one whistleblower or leaker away from a constitutional crisis bringing the agency to their knees and this whole thing shut down under review. It’s just not worth the risk, especially when all the safe guards they put in place still effectively allow them to do what they need to do. The only reason for them not to do these things would be because of reckless institutional laziness. Like I said with all these safety measures they can still do everything they need to do. There is no reason for them not to. Especially since it’s so risky. Edit: but I will concede they probably do break the rules all the time which is why it’s a problem. But you have to show the courts that their rule breaking evil acts outweighs the benefits enough

8089	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Qubes is *technically* not a Linux distribution, but really its close enough. It is definitely the most secure OS available to the masses (who knows what else is out there). Its technically a Xen hypervisor with various Linux VMs. FYI, Qubes 4 is going to prolly be coming out soon, and it will require a fresh install. Qubes 3.2 will receive updates for a while yet though.Be advised gaming will *not* really be possible with Qubes unless you do very technical and not recommended things like PCI passthrough etc. Aside from Qubes, I would say Debian, Arch, and Fedora are prolly the top three atm. Fedora is pretty damn secure out of the box, gets updates quickly, has full package hardening, and has SELinux up and running. Debian has a good security team and AppArmor out of the gate, but lax package hardening. Arch is the most difficult of the three to install and to maintain, and especially to setup securely. However, it is the only distro I know of that packages the hardening patchset (maintained/dev'd by the guy who devs Copperhead for Android), and its package hardening is great like Fedora. This hardening patchset is no joke- it has many features ported from the last free grsecurity patchset, and a number of things Daniel (the Copperhead dev and an Arch Trusted User) has dev'd himself. Arch will need a kernel recompile for AppArmor, or a *bunch* of shit to run SELinux. If Qubes works for you, use it. If not or if you need gaming, I'd try Fedora, Debian, and then Arch (in that order) stopping at the first one that makes you happy.**EDIT** sys-whonix is the whonix linux distribution incorporated into Qubes OS. Whonix is a distribution designed to be run virtualized and designed to protect Tor. Qubes has it incorporated into the installer if you so wish, but Whonix can be run via Virtualbox or KVM on a Linux distro (or even on Windows/Mac OS using Virtualbox).

8112	 termapt	 I think secure email still matters to an extent even if you deal with people using non-private email. If you use Gmail for example, you basically allow Google to know about everything about your email, not only the bits that go through their service. But not everyone uses Gmail, e.g. airlines, internet vendors etc. often use their own servers that I think Google doesn't have access to. When you're using a private email service you're still protecting that part of your privacy, plus the correspondence you have with people from other email providers. For me, using private email is more about not letting one company know everything about me than about total privacy.

8121	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I try to separate what's best for me from what's best for someone else. I don't like Fedora for one reason: it releases really often, and I hate reinstalling. Debian stable remains stable for 2 years, and it can be painlessly updated between stable releases. Arch never needs to be reinstalled as it's rolling release (technically Debian Sid can do this as well, but its not as stable as Arch in this case).And I still haven't switched to Debian. The only thing holding me back at this point is the package hardening, which both Arch and Fedora deliver with (they both have full hardening). Fedora is a good distro, it has SELinux out of the box, full package hardening, and its pretty painless to install, setup and use. Its not for me, but for most who focus on security I reason its a better choice than Debian. Arch is tempting to recommend, but when a person asks such a question, I assume they don't have the necessary Linux experience to do Arch securely. You will notice I put Arch after Debian.On the Tor bit, do you have a source or proof? Tor is definitely useful to give corporations the middle finger, or at least to make the cost of identifying you much higher for them. I am doubtful even three letter agencies can *reliably* beat Tor for everyone. And even if they can, if everyone used it, it would make identifying a person much more expensive.If you're referring to Meltdown/Spectre, the key is to make sure NoScript is blocking all javascript and only very sparingly with websites you trust should you enable anything. All 3 of the Linux distros I mentioned have patched Meltdown with KPTI, and Spectre v2 fixes are coming with gcc 7.3 in the next few days; Linux 4.14.14 has basic retpoline support, and with gcc 7.3 you will be able to recompile the kernel for full protection from Spectre v2 (userspace still vulnerable until you compile the applications to have retpoline support as well). Recompiling libvirt with retpoline support should protect Whonix well enough where it's not possible to read memory and potentially find one's actual IP.Spectre v1 will still be a danger, and unfortunately I think that's going to require intel microcode updates and a kernel command line switch to mitigate it. I guess we'll see on this one.I have resorted to using NoScript to try and prevent Spectre style attacks, and this plus KPTI will work until we get full retpoline support as well as microode updates from Intel.

8126	 torku	 Sure, other may not use encrypted email which means your communications are not secure from governments and hackers (assuming get governments and hackers can get the data). But those communications are spread out across dozens if not hundreds of sources whereas your inbox is one source. That’s why it’s important to have an encrypted and fully protected inbox. You can’t fully protect an email once you hit send - even if you send via ProtonMail you don’t know what the recipient will do with the email. However, you can protect the contents of your inbox. You have three safe options: move it offline, delete it all, or use protonmail or a similar service to keep it secure. Email is inherently insecure. Just like sending a letter via post office you have no control over what the recipient will do with the letter or how she will protect or share the information. But you can control how you protect your box of letters at home from the government who may want to read them or thieves who may want to steal the box. 	
8127	 faithle55	 Well, if you have a commitment to honesty and then Donald Trump gets put in charge, maybe your honesty will compel you to remove statements about honesty from your web site since the President is the most dishonest man ever to hold the post... and you know you can't be honest any more.

And i never said that google doesn't default to SSL, most things do since you can get certs free.  You would use !g if you want to search google, and there is a different behaviour from googles side: see the link

8130	 general_0408	 Story time.I used to work for a company that had the option to encrypt emails built into our email client. Official company policy was to encrypt all email containing confidential company information, but nobody ever did it (All employees were trained on what constitutes each of the 3 different classification levels we used). I always found that frustrating, so I would try my best to actually use encryption when I was supposed to. Every time I sent an email encrypted, I would get a comment from the recipient wondering why I felt it was necessary.I once had to send a document containing sensitive tax info to someone else in the company, so I sent it encrypted. The person emailed me back saying, "I can't open the email, please turn off encryption and resend it." I thought to myself, "I sure as shit am not about to send this in plain text, so figure out what the hell you're doing wrong." Though the actual reply I sent her used a bit more *business appropriate* language. Our encryption feature was so easy a monkey could use it. I mean, it has to be, cuz it needs to be designed to be usable by even the most computer illiterate moron when you work at that big of a corporation. When composing an email to be sent to someone else with a company email address, you just click the "encrypt this email" button in the toolbar, then click OK. That's it, nothing else. When you receive it, the email client automatically decrypts it for you. The recipient has to do absolutely nothing special. Seriously, a 4 year old couldn't fuck this up, so I was dumbfounded as to why this lady was having trouble with it.Turns out she was forwarding it to her personal email address because she liked the layout of her personal email client more. One of the features of the encryption is that if you forward an encrypted email, it becomes unreadable. Hence it's only available to the intended recipient.When it comes to business security, the company can roll out the most sophisticated, most secure systems imaginable. But incompetent employees will always be your downfall.	
8131	 Lord___Smith	 The NSA is the case if they're no long hypocrites.	
8132	 FeatheryAsshole	 &gt; Turns out she was forwarding it to her personal email address uuggggghh. Wow. I guess you really have to set it up in a way to make unencrypted email positively impossible. One of my previous employers worked on something like that; don't quite remember how it was supposed to work, though.On the other hand, employees will probably start sending messages and documents via Telegram messenger or something. 	
8133	 JustaReverseFridge	 What are you trying to do, If your trying to irc type chat then Riot.im is better, if your trying to call/text then signal is better, both of those arent good options for what you would use them for

8140	 FeatheryAsshole	 My Email provider (mailbox.org) and VPN (nordvpn) are like 1€/month each.Online storage is indeed more expensive, though. Did you look into VPS? If you're able to set something like nextcloud up on it (turnkey linux might help), it would probably be cheaper; especially considering that you can set up more than one service for no additional cost on the same VPS.

8144	 FeatheryAsshole	 I'd trust Flickr about as far as I can throw it. If you only care about third-party hacks or accidental exposure because of shitty settings, at least use Google photos. Google might spy on you themselves, and let three letter agencies in on it, but their services are really secure from everything else.	
8145	 freethenation	 They simply don't do the same things. This extension does not block anything. It only reports fingerprinting attempts. From years of web scraping I know stopping JS fingerprinting is hard and often makes you stand out (https://multiloginapp.com/how-canvas-fingerprint-blockers-make-you-easily-trackable/).Also, turn on your beloved ScriptSafe (chrome or FF) and go here https://browserleaks.com/webgl and allow JS.

8148	 FeatheryAsshole	 XMPP is great, but it seems a little complicated to set up with encryption on desktop (I got it working, but it's optional and your friends might not feel/be able to use encryption with it). It might be better to chose a messenger that is bundled with an account and encrypts out of the box. However, in my experience people don't want to switch again if you just barely succeeded in getting them on Telegram. I'm kinda in the same situation as you; I guess I had that one chance to get them to switch to something decent and blew it  by picking Telegram.

8155	 ABaseDePopopopop	 Depends who you want to protect from.If it's from other people, services like Flickr are fine. If it's from data-mining companies, you need to find a service you trust. It's not going to be free.If it's from hackers or authorities, you need encryption and it's going to make them much more difficult to share to your friends.	
8156	 BifurcatedTales	 If you tell someone a secret it’s no longer a secret ;)	
8157	 ABaseDePopopopop	 You can get a good and private email service for 12€/year (Posteo; Mailbox.org; or buying your own domain at your preferred registrar, I like Gandi.net).Posteo and Mailbox.org include calendar and contact syncing.A good VPN is worth about 5€/month.&gt;At least 10-20 GB space for my photos, voice memos, docs - it could be 60 euros for year.For this it depends why you want to have it in the "cloud". Is it for backup, syncing, or sharing…?If it's just for backup, you have much cheaper solutions. Look at Backblaze if you use Windows, or if you're on Linux and not afraid of a bit of technical learning, rsync.net for example, or even Amazon S3.	
8158	 [deleted]	 So why bother using ddg if you resort to using !g some of the time? You should never use !g, !s startpage uses google results so there's no need to. No there isn't, you think they don't know what you're searching for or where you are yet return the right search results by magic? 	
8159	 Aventura_Viper	 On the Backblaze front, B2 is a veryversatile and cheap option when paired with backup software, of which many are available. You could also use B2 as general cloud storage. Take a look at a few of the integrations [here](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/integrations.html).Encrypting usual cloud storage providers is also easy with [cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/).

Then wait for a week for account verification and approval. Finally get approval and try to create a VCC and get message that account verification is required AGAIN. So I gave up, unlinked my bank account, reenabled 2FA, changed my password. Privacy.com will go out of business with that kind of (dis)service. Also, you cannot delete a Privacy account ever.  Are any of these better? Secure?

8186	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I'm going to focus on the question directly.Consider for a moment how insanely rich companies like Facebook, Google, etc are. Why is that? If they were all middle class folks with small profit margins, one could say that the data they collect/sell is paying a liveable amount of money beyond providing the services they provide.They are spending *way* less providing you a service then they are making selling your data. It's really that simple.Is it worth it? I say no, but perhaps someone else says yes. By continuing to use these services we breathe life into them, and we contribute to the rapidly gaining trend of power centralization. Power centralization results in belligerence of those in power (we see this with Google and Facebook all the time), and ultimately leaves us at the mercy of those who now lord over us.In my opinion, power should always be tracked, matched, and thus the belligerence of power should always be held in check by a People maintaining a healthy spirit of resistance to tyranny. The battlefront between the most dangerous tyrants today and We the People is privacy; governments usurp it, corporations use technology to convert it into their profits, and thus inevitably if we fail to control it We the People will be subjugated by their mastery of it.This isn't just a question of monetary exchange or of convenience; this is a *war for the control of mental space.* If we lose, our mental space is controlled by governments and corporations, and thus Liberty and Freedom are dead. If we lose, it will be little different from the slavery of the past; slaves had no control of their physical space, and thus very little control over their mental space. In our case we would have no control over our mental space, and thus very little control over our physical space.I absolutely believe that a free society depends on privacy, and that the 4th amendment's primary intention is to safeguard this liberty. I believe that if you allow a someone to destroy your privacy, you allow them to destroy free thought, you allow them to destroy the basis for free speech, and that fundamentally you become slaves of the someone who destroyed it.

8189	 ABaseDePopopopop	 Exactly. Even if all your contacts use non-private email providers, you're still protecting all your automatic emails from retailers and similar. Nowadays with people using mobile messaging instead, notifications and bookings are actually the largest parts of my email traffic by far.And it matters. Google for instance is particularly interested in those emails; they are easy to parse and they indicate where, when, and what you shop. Objects but also bookings. Also all the websites you have an account with.	
8190	 Benjamin1991Freedom	 You just trust me, I'm from the NSA.	
8191	 JeffersonsSpirit	 The reason why this quote is repeated so often and why it stirs up such disgust in us is because *it demonstrates the attitude and belligerence of those in a position of power.*Phrases like this are exactly why the People must constantly maintain a healthy spirit of resistance to centralized power; without a healthy spirit of resistance, attitudes like this will forge the chains of future tyranny.

8222	 tiiaj	 It looks like you haven't really decided on your threat model; you just follow the general recommendations, whether they apply to you or not. And you'll never finish because there will always be the next best thing that you think you need to have/do. And pay for, in some cases.So stop for a moment and think. Do you need "secure email" or will Signal or Wire do? In how far does a VPN make sense in your threat model? Do you need encrypted cloud storage? Do you have to cover several OSes?Also, being too privacy-oriented will make you stand out and interesting. Go with the common tools for non-private stuff and you'll be much less of a target.In my case, I switched to DuckDuckGo (free), ditched Google calendar and mail for the Apple equivalent (with local calendars for confidential things), limit the number of products (HW + SW) I use, use Signal for confidential information (only), and sync.com as a Cloud provider. I cancelled Facebook and Whatsapp and I don't regret that. In total that's less than 100€ per year including my donation to Signal, and it fits my needs.So again, do your own risk assessment, give priorities if necessary, and you'll be on the right track.

I have bad memories with online editors going down along with the web browser just when I had to submit an assignment which was 2 mins due. I would definitely look into RAM upgrades for your computer if you have less than 4GB for better VM performance.I can't say much about VM settings since I'm just an average guy.

8230	 tekeous	 Macs won't boot Parted Magic some of the time, either. It has to do with Apple being able to use their own proprietary drivers and baking them in to macOs, but the Linux community doesn't have them.Some things, like the Touch Bar, are either reverse engineered or don't work. Too many things not supported, like Apple's custom chips, touch bar, iSight cam, AirPort, keyboard, firmware, and the thing just won't boot.tl;dr Newer Macs bad for Linux.

I don’t have the app on my phone , just Messenger out of necessity to contact my friends. If I could i’d rely only on iMessage.I recently asked me if I should change computer and started to really dig down to how companies make their money. What’s their business model? I think as consumer, we should look beyond the product/service and understand how the company plan to make money out of us. Not surprisingly, I decided to stay in the Apple ecosystem because even if it has its own faults, it’s still the best alternative (for a non tech guy) that I could find.I love Chromebooks and Android but can’t accept their business model. Microsoft’s Windows 10 is still buggy as fuck and their telemetry has gone too far. It leaves me with Apple and it’s overpriced hardware. But I decided it’s fine for me, because I’d rather pay a one time fee with actual money than thousands time « attentional fees » with advertising.My 2 cents

And despite the headlines claiming that this is somehow a privacy improvement, it still does not allow me to disable the reporting. And what's worse is that in order to install this free app to see what information Microsoft are forcefully extracting, I must first sign up with Microsoft in order to use the Windows Store, thereby giving up a name, email address, phone number, which will inevitably be tied to the information that they already collect about me such as the serial number of the machine and every website I visit if I accepted the default settings (as millions of users surely did).	
8252	 andrewornot	 I think turn off Siri in iCloud refers to Apple's recent efforts to have Siri remember your settings between devices. One Siri for all, instead of a separate Siri for each device that doesn't remember what you said.  So your iCloud account is connected in a way, but I don't think the actual voice data is stored in the cloud, only the preferences that Siri remembers about you. And if you turn Siri off, then those preferences get deleted.	
8253	 UnrecognizableBusboy	 Good answer here.  Ultimately, there's no good cloud storage for something you don't want to be seen by ANYONE. Imagine the comparison in the real world.  You have some sensitive photo prints, and your neighbor runs a photo storage and sharing service.  You walk up to their front door and hand over a pile of photos, some you have written "private" on. Now, what do you know about how they're sharing your photos?  Will they actually put in effective safeguards to protect your "private" photos?  If they say they've encrypted your photos, how can you be sure their encryption is sound? What if the authorities come knocking and ask to make copies? It's really tough to ensure your sensitive photos are really private when they're out of your direct control.

8286	 JeffersonsSpirit	 This is a means for the government to immediately eliminate financially/socially any dissident or dissenter. This is a way for government to become Gods who can completely eliminate a person's social existence on a whim.Before you call this a conspiracy theory, remember the same insult was tossed before the Snowden leaks. It will start off restrained and eventually grow into a tool of oppression. Just *look* at how this crap keeps coming *everywhere.* Its in all countries, nearly all corporations, etc etc. It is the systemic centralization of power where those with power oppress- now or eventually- those who don't.Stuff like this is about as bad as 100% digital money issued by a nation state. Imagine when they can completely eliminate your wealth on a whim. Imagine *negative* interest rates where banks charge you for the privilege of making money on your money. If you think that financial lobbyists wont make this happen, you haven't been paying attention.You- no disrespect intended here- need to open your eyes man. I know you want to believe that our government isn't bad and I know you want to be optimistic about what good can come from each action, but that is not the world we live in. We are seeing a *war* develop before our eyes- a war of those with power aiming to gain even more power from those who cannot compete. Apathy, division, and acquiescence is not the solution- solidarity and *fighting for our rights and against this shit* is the solution.

8294	 FinnishCobweb	 You're going to have to draw a line between privacy and convenience here. As you should already know, you wont get much privacy from mainstream Android and iOS. At least on Android, you have alternative roms LinageOS,CopperheadOS, etc. I chose an Iphone because for my threat model, it makes sense. It's a device that can be use by pretty much anyone, great app support, while providing solid end-point security. I cant speak for Android but on iOS you can limit some of the sharing of your data that is sent to Apple but i wouldn't put alot of faith in that if you really need privacy though. As far as carriers go, i just use a simply pre-paid plan. That may or not be a problem for you depending on if you are a heavy streamer. If non of what i say makes any sense, just limit how you use a mobile device.	
8295	 ItsInTheOtherHand	 I appreciate the advice, and I'm sure this would be useful if truly had to be untrackable. But this is *more* privacy than I need right now and *less* functionality.I need a fully featured smartphone, that is  essentially current gen, and I need to use certain apps, I also need my phone to be able to receive calls/messages/email whener it is on (a faraday cage is self-deafearing then) main concerns are about: - **Securing communications** (for this I use Protonmail, Signal, Tor, VPNs, Monero, etc, and encourage my contacts to do the same).- **Hardening my phone:** Making sure contents are encrypted, keeping out all malware  (only running trusted programs), stopping a remote attacker from stealing my data, messages, pictures, etc.- **Giving as little information to commercial entities as possible**: Being as anonymous online as possible  (less unique identifier, personal info, etc), while *still being able to access the resources I need*. Not sharing data  (location, contacts, device IDs, etc) with apps unless they are trusted *and* I believe they actually need it to work (e.g. only using Uber/Lyft in a browser over VPN with a masked number and prepaid/masked card). Obviously this requires granular control over permissions, ability to monitor/block individual data streams, etc.What I *don't* currently need.- **The ability to move around like a ghost.** I'm not going to share my location data with corporations, but I am currently nor overly concerned with being tracked by cell towers. Yes, Verizon/the NSA *could* track my location via phone pings or reconstruct my motions at another time, but (A) my daily routine is not really a secret (B) cell network based location is not something that is being sold to commercial entities. Yes, I would like to stop this *if given the choice*, but the cost  (being unreachable/disconnected most of the time cause my phone's in a bag) is not worth it. If I need to go somewhere unnoticed, I leave my phone at home and drive  (My car has  GPS).Which brings me back to my original question about Copperhead/other OSes and people's experience with them.  Hopefully I can get some answers.

8298	 ItsInTheOtherHand	 &gt;The biggest benefits for me come with freedom of being able to root. Its important security trade off but its why I do not really see much value personally in Copperhead. I was under the impression that Copperhead allows users to root/have full system access and is the best OS for having granular control over permissions, individual data streams, etc. Is this not true?&gt;With respect to Android vs iOS. This is no argument. Its fact. iOS offer significantly superior security than android counterpart. Are you saying this in *absolute terms*, or relative to the average device. I was under the impression  (from lurking this sub and other forums for the past year), that iOS offers better security/privacy for the *average user* (of smartphones) especially those who are not willing/don't have the skills to get into the nitty gritty  (basically 99% of people), but that if you want *near complete control* over your device, an Android Custom ROM is really the only option. Supposedly becaue, while Apple is good *at what they do*, the close source nature of iOS means that it is *impossible* for the user to access/control certain things, and impossible to verify others. Thus, those unviewable areas could be compromising you without knowing it (coupled with the fact that because Apple has complete control, if they become forced to comply in a general sense, or in your case, with attackers, you're fucked). I.E, ir coudp have infinite backdoors you can't close. This what has lead me to look into a custom ROM, since I am willing to take the time/effort to learn/do what is necessary. Is there anything incorrect in what I said?&gt; the often underreported and overlooked benefit of secure enclave chip which hard coded from factory allows iOS software AND hardware to be DFU reset (software, firmware, baseband, etc) to cryptographically verified state. Mind blowing to see this type of tech on non-DOD kitThis seems impressive, but is it not still outweighed by the clouded source/proprietary nature of the iPhone/iOS system for those who want maximum privacy?	
8299	 ItsInTheOtherHand	 Sorry for the long response time, out of Wi-Fi range.&gt;What is your threat model?  What do you need to use your phone for?I think I outlined this best in another [comment](https://reddit.com/comments/7sqsoy/comment/dt8i94m). Maybe I won't double post it here.&gt;You should also consider an iPhone, since they're arguably more secure than Android devices.I have serious doubt about this, due to the closed source/proprietery nature of iOS. I [mentioned this](https://reddit.com/comments/7sqsoy/comment/dt8j9li) to they guy below you.

8307	 duffmanhb	 Possibly. Modern teaching of it tries to wash over this and do some reimagining of our constitutional origins. But if you look into the founders thoughts on these subjects it’s pretty clear that the constitution was to ensure the rich govern the people as they didn’t trust the people could make rational decisions on their own due to lack of education and envy of the rich. This is why originally it was only male land owners who could vote. And the whole protect the minority from the majority included protecting the minority rich from the pitch fork wielding poor majority. It’s also why the saying “pursuit of life, liberty, and property” was switched to “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” as they didn’t think property should be a right for all people (even though the main political philosophers behind the constitution agreed property should be a right) because that would give the common man political power. This should be taught in just about any intro constitution class. At least it was for me when I was taking con-law.

There are vast amounts of lectures online that cover the founders thoughts and reasonings behind this. The constitution was amazing and has aged well, especially as we treat it as a living thing, and by all means the founders did mean good to give protections to the average person and that was great, but they intended governance was to be done by the elites and that had to be protected.

8313	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I haven't installed Linux on my pc for over 6 years- that 6 year old install is still completely up-to-date, doesn't spy on me, and functions perfectly. I use a distribution that is rolling-release and doesn't even prioritize stability instead focusing on bleeding edge software and minimalism... and I haven't had a kernel panic with it ever. Linux stability is better than Windows, Linux security is better than Windows (especially when you use MAC, have full package hardening, and hardened kernel patchsets), and with the Linux software ecosystem being dominantly FOSS its privacy isn't even in the same universe as Windows.I can understand an argument based on someone needing certain proprietary software, and I can even understand prioritizing familiarity or preference, but stability, privacy, or security are all things you cannot use to discredit the choice of using Linux.

Maybe like 8 years ago when I played around with gentoo for a while.That having been said, I still have a hard time using it as a daily driver, simply because some things are better supported on Windows (of course some things are better supported on Linux).Anyway, this isn't to say that anyone should be using any particular OS, just to say that worrying about kernel panics really isn't a practical concern with any modern desktop distribution.

I happily managed with the free version up until recently (limited to 200 trades). I honestly don't know how I'd manage without it. You can use my referrer link so that if/when you need to upgrade you'll get a 10% discount - https://cointracking.info?ref=P754792. I do manual entry through choice, however they fully support Exchange API and direct wallet API imports.	
8361	 plugubius	 &gt; Important: The maintainers of this project don't keep a data base of user data.That is not a blanket statement regarding data sent by the browser extension that spies on your activity on a site designed to spy on you.	
8362	 jmw74	 IMO, the only way facebook users are going to understand the value of the data they give away, is for it to be turned against them in an obvious way.Since facebook has control of the data, and they're not dumb enough to make the exploitation obvious to their users, it's going to take some kind of hack that liberates facebook's data. Then the algorithms can go to work figuring out, for example, who's having an affair, and then the blackmailing will begin. If you ever read a headline that facebook's database has been hacked, expect bitcoin prices to go up immediately after :)

I don’t care what government agency or company sees my data, I just don’t want pictures of me sucking cock to appear on my stream or end up elsewhere online. I am not doing anything wrong so I have nothing to hide in that sense. It’s about protecting my image from people I know and not wanting these images circulated.

8393	 sting_12345	 Good info here in the above post.  You can pretty much cut out google from your android system by using lineageOS or copperhead (too few devices supported).  LineageOS is fine and if you want to use google services without them knowing, then MicroG is a great way to do it. If not then you can cut them completely out but it will be a great loss of daily convenience so it matter what you are willing to share. I think lineageOS with encryption working and MicroG using googles service without them knowing who you are is a great compromise.  YOu get the functionality of having it but not the loss of privacy/security.  YOu still can use play store apps via Yalp app from fdroid.  It's the best way honestly, it's no loss of functionality and use an email of your own server or protonmail.  Text with signal or wire  or threema only.  Place calls with signal or threema and you pretty much nullify the broad general collection of data the NSA is doing and giving to the FBI/DOJ.  Now if your threat model is the FBI directly after you, then you might want to forgo MicroG and just use apps that use sockets to work.  It won't be fun but it will work and be secure.  Think of it as a "work" phone for text/comms and a 'home' phone that uses microG and is no loss of functionality.  Just depending on your threat model but microG is very sufficient for most people.	
8394	 xgwujrep	 Sudo and Hushed provide fully functional webrtc phone numbers from Twilio. I'm sure there are many other retailers for webrtc softphones.The "phone" is really a browser. But's it's loud, the DTF works, and you don't hafta shout into it for someone to understand you.	
8395	 mraehtmai	 Interesting input from everyone, and some things I hadn't taken into consideration such as companies who use private email servers that don't flow through the main companies.	
8396	 CptHammer_	 I think with his recent pudge, he'd be a good fit, but I was like 20 then. So this is more of a younger, "Spys Like Us" thing.	
8397	 sting_12345	 This doesn't have to be hard but you must pay for some things.  Use lineageOS with microG for your phone.  Signal/threema/wire/wickr for comms and use a no-knowledge encrypted cloud like tresorit or sync.com  tresorit gives me 200 gb for 5 dollars per month.  Or use any cloud service with cryptomator or boxcryptor (my preferred service) which is free for ONE cloud account. Protonmail is free if you want base email and not customized domain name.  ProtonVPN is also free for their base servers.  Tutanota is also free encrypted mail to use.  I don't see the big huge cost problem here.  You will have to pay a little something for these things if you don't want to be the product.  That's the point.

8400	 MagneTismen	 I'm not sure I follow you on the last part, why would bitcoin prices rise?	
8401	 jmw74	 Sorry, didn't connect the dots there.Blackmailers will ask for payment in bitcoin, and since many people will be buying it to pay them, it will raise the price. Assuming all that other stuff actually happens of course.	
8402	 duffmanhb	 Okay well I majored in constitutional law in political science. So I’m done having this argument with someone obviously not educated on the subject besides being pedantic. 	
8403	 TheWorstKindOfHelp	 Because online ransoms/blackmail are usually required to be paid for in cryptocurrency, for obvious reasons.   Even if they ask for a privacy-minded coin, most people would have to buy bitcoin, etherium, or one of the few common ones available on fiat exchanges, then convert to their needed coin.   If someone was using machine learning, and Facebook's database, to blackmail people, it would be enormous in both scope, and potential for damage.   Likely enough people would want to pay up, that it would make record demand for the few "on- ramp" coins, driving the price "to the moon".	
8404	 MagneTismen	 Thank you, I guessed something similar but wasn't sure why it would be bitcoin and not some of the other ones but yeah, BTC and ETH would probably be the go-to candidates here. At least for now :)	
8405	 MagneTismen	 Thanks :) Like I replied to the other guy, my question was more about why BTC and not some other coin but since BTC, ETH, and LTC are the most common ones to first buy and then exchange for something else I can see how this would be the case.

8416	 duffmanhb	 We are talking about the founding constitution as it was intended, it was originally designed that way, this was clear from the founders own thoughts, and the drafting of the constitution. The constitution has changed over time... Our opinions and interpretations of it conveniently evolved to correct these issues. Just look at the evolution of the right to vote... Eventually it just allowed landowners, but then allowed all educated white men over 21, to blacks, to all men over 18, and finally to women. Originally to just vote, you had to be an educated white male landowner. That was literally the requirement to participate in democracy. The founders talk in lengths in their personal writings the importance for the educated and cultured elites to run the levers of democracy because they aren't foolish enough to join the mob and cause democracy to eat itself alive. They wanted rights, and freedoms, and a new roman empire type beacon of democracy in the world. They wanted all these higher freedoms and rights to be given to all people of the free society, but by all intents and purposes, the actual direction of the government and government itself, was supposed to be reserved for the elites.Over time, the "living constitution" approach slowly pivoted around these flaws and corrected them... As well as our retelling of history to sort of brush over the underlying part of history. But it was "Yes we have a great free open society, but the elites are the only ones who can be trusted to run it."

The 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th amendments made sure that there could be no limitation to voting minus being a felon and set the min age to 18. For someone who went to college for this, you are not winning. In fact, I cannot fin a federal law stating anything in regards to what you are saying. There were attempts by states, but the aforementioned amendments took care of those.

Its the passport to instant God Mode and encourages the most extreme levels of belligerence power can muster.Look at Snowden- they insta-revoked his passport and bam he's stuck in Russia. Now imagine you can't work/buy food/start your car/use the bus/get any of your money/etc/etc. Who knows what a future dystopian version of America can inflict upon someone who challenges authority or who encourages others to question the paradigm of the time?You realize they tried to blackmail MLK Jr. right? You realize that the government saw him as a threat, targeted him with cointelpro, and that he was under surveillance? This was in the 60s! Imagine the next MLK Jr. when we all have National ID cards biometrically-imbued that are necessary for any action as a citizen. This future person couldn't get on the internet (sorry your access rights have been revoked), couldn't buy food or get a place to sleep (sorry your access rights have been revoked), etc etc etc. Such an ID is a tool they possess and they control- that tool can be has harmless or nefarious as their intentions. I think most of us here can see their intentions are already shit- let alone in the future.

8462	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Corporations do their best to make the People illiterate when it comes to technology- the People being illiterate gives these corporations an advantage, and an advantage means profit. It really isn't exclusive to technology (as in electronics, etc) either- watch some TV commercials (or some internet ads) and you'll quickly see that the advertisements aren't meant to increase a person's understanding or competency. The objective is targeting insecurity or the desire for social prestige to sell, and to do so they must keep the citizenry ignorant of any higher technical or existential thought.If the educational system created a materially-frugal and mentally-rich citizenry starting tomorrow, the entire global economic system would crash; the entire system relies on the pursuit of ostensible opulence, frivolous consumption, targeted social insecurities, and the insistence that such actions are so mandatory that one must take on extreme levels of debt to pursue them to a sufficient level.We are in a class war, and We the People are losing hard.	
8463	 GET_A_LAWYER	 1. OCR software would only detect micro-printing if it were specifically designed to do so.  Even if OCR software were designed to do so, it couldn't record the micro-printed information in the text of the file, only in the file's metadata, so copying and pasting the OCR'd text into a new text file should resolve that concern. Use the appropriate level of paranoia, Photoshop recognizes and prevents editing of US currency.2. Yes. Doing a non-contiguous select of black, inverting the selection, and deleting the background would do it. This has the advantage that any spurious selection (e.g. dots in an area that should be white) would be immediately visible. Alternately increasing the contrast to 100% should cause any subtle markings to convert to white. 3. It depends. Photoshop files save history. Some file types store smaller copies of the image for use as a file icon, which can be extracted even after the image itself has changed. Some filters are reversible, such as motion blur.There's a reason the government censors with black bars, it works. (But if you use the highlight tool in Acrobat it will leave the text unless you export the file as an image rather than PDF.)Source: Non-expert with some software knowledge.

No idea what you did when you tried Linux (maybe your hardware was a problem/incompatible), but your experience is definitely an exception.	
8467	 AtBios	 Hmm, I never heard about OpenMailbox before. They sound interesting , but there is nothing about encryption on there. So I assume nothing is encrypted?

8470	 AtBios	 Oh, I completely missed that! Thanks for the info. But yeah, it seems a bit weird that they aren't talking more about it and such. Feels a lot like a buzzword when there is no more info. 	
8471	 0xc000014C	 Thanks for your answer. I'm asking because I scanned a letter to an image. I edited out personal information like my name and address and other obvious trackers like bar-codes and QR-codes, and ID numbers.1. You said micro-printing wouldn't be detected/saved if it were converted to a word file for example, but what if it's saved as an image file - jpeg,jpg, PNG..etc.2. I'm not very familiar with Photoshop, I used it as an example. Are you familiar with GIMP? would a regular blur on a selection (not motion blur) be enough to distort any micro-prints? When I do that it appears to dilute darker pixels, making them lighter.3. Let me be specific: I'm talking about remove modifications saved in the resulting exported files like jpeg,jpg, PNG, not the source files containing the layers.From your last statement if sounds like the blacker the bluring, the better. Is that right?	
8472	 E_JackieLee	 I know, I don't feel too comfortable with how little information they provide. If the email service is encrypted properly then 500GB for 5 Euro/month is a great deal though

If they felt it was necessary to log IP addresses for just the beta, or thought it was necessary to change the privacy policy, the invitation and updates would have been the place to do so. Instead, all they did was tout "new features and security improvements" and hid this crucial detail.  What's more outrageous, they said this: "Internally we've discussed if we should release our new beta client only to Premium users first. We've dismissed this idea quickly because we want all of you to take part in our exciting journey of bringing privacy to the world!"While pretending to be generous they deceived their users into having their data logged.

Many users asked us how they can find out if someone else besides themselves has been logged into their account."Client and IP address are only stored encrypted" means that only you can decrypt and read them. We don't have the possibility to decrypt them! :-)	
8492	 sgitkene	 The extension is just making obvious a subset of what facebook tracks. If you don't trust it, trust that the project being open souce and in service to you as a user someone would have complained by now. If you use facebook at all, use it in conjunction with this addon. If you don't use fb, no need to set it up just for this use case, except for curiosity.	
8493	 TopMosby	 How can you use any software than, if you don't trust an open source softwareand think the creators are lying? 	
8494	 ghost3321	 Thx for the explanation, but I don't use any social media.	
8495	 TheBrainSlug	 Honestly, something like Ubuntu is just as easy as Windows/OSX these days. Even easier in some ways -package management, in particular, makes installing and updating software *much* easier and safer on Linux than on it is on Windows/OSX. Phones are certainly still a little bit harder (and iOS is probably a fair choice there), but unless you need particular proprietary software that does not exist on Linux there really is no reason not to use Linux for desktop these days.	
8496	 ghost3321	 I would trust an open source software more than a closed one. But as I said, I  can't read code so it doesn't matter.But as far as trust goes, let's just say I have trust issues. And also it's fb I don't trust (among other things).	
8497	 OpinionKangaroo	 well this looks interesting anyway :P would like to try this one someone elses account :D (and yeah i don't have one, deleted mine a while ago)now i will only have to poke someone to install this :D	
8498	 lfod14	 See, and that's the problem. What do TWO people have to do with an outlook on how government should be run? Those two are NOT the Libertarian party... their TWO people and don't reflect everybody no different than Donald Trump reflects all of the right or Hillary reflects all of the left. People are way too caught up in voting for a specific name rather than focusing on the ideals of a political belief system. Not saying people should always vote based on the letter after a name either, but people aren't weighing the options anymore. You say "Goodness no" yet both of them have a very impressive track record for working across party lines. I'm from MA so I've seen Weld in action and he didn't have the problems Trump has in a majority Dem run state. I will 100% agree Johnson ran a pathetic joke of a campaign and had zero chance of winning a high school political debate, but its really beside the point in the end. Anybody that pays attention in politics knows that it's really not about the president, but the people they put in power beneath them and their ability to work with others that make all the differences. Bill Clinton and Obama abused Exec Power and made themselves dictators but NORMALLY that's more important.	
8499	 NerdillionTwoMillion	 * First buy a VPN subscription* don't use the reddit app use your browser instead because the app will be tied to your Google or apple play store account which will be tied to your pH number* use privacy extensions on your browser such as unlock origin https everywhere and privacy badger* **the most important thing to remember is you are your own weakest link** even if you have the best privacy set up in the world, it takes just one little mistake such as posting your name to render all your efforts to obsfurcate your identity useless. So just remember not to post ANYTHING that may reveal things about you.	
8500	 ZachariahOG	 WeLeakInfo is what you're looking for	
8501	 E_JackieLee	 1. Despite this being a new feature (one requested by users, even) you did not inform the users in any way like you did with 2FA, for example.2. I refer to your answer here (https://tutanota.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/511572-can-i-use-tutanota-anonymously-do-you-log-ip-addr) where you clearly say "We do not log IP addresses when you login". You did not say "When you login, we log and store IP addresses but in encrypted servers where only you can see them". If that was going to change you really should have let users know. Users have a right to know when they're starting to be logged, even if the information is only accessible to them. Because now whenever I use Tutanota I have to take into account the fact that if God forbid someone finds out my password they would now have access to my email login habits and my approximate location, in addition to the content of my emails. I had forgotten to turn on VPN when I found out about this new (unwelcome, to me at least) feature and now this is a record of my life I can't take back or modify. I trusted you when you said they WEREN'T STORED TO BEGIN WITH and thought I did not have to worry about this specifically. To me, the fact that I am being logged itself is deeply troubling.3. To give credit where credit is due I have to take back the "invades privacy" part of the title because when I read "only stored encrypted" I interpreted it as "stored encrypted on Tutanota's servers where users AND TUTANOTA can see the data but others can't". Which is why I said "only stored encrypted" doesn't mean anything. It is some solace to know only I have access to the data. But again, this should have been clarified upfront.Suffice to say I will not be logging into the beta client again and the moment Tutanota makes it official I am switching.	
8502	 chemisorb	 Best to get accurate information from the source before publicly spreading wrongful information. They have as much access to this information as they do to your email contents.	
8503	 TestyTestis	 **"Get back your Facebook data."**Oh, cool. So now I don't have to mind what I say on Facebook. I can post all the opinionated crap everyone else does, AND not have to worry about appendages to my invisible Facebook dossier. Sweet!

8505	 australian_user	 Congrats on being more privacy conscious!The everyday setup I prefer is a privacy-tweaked browser for sites I login to (eg Twitter, banking, email) and [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en) for read-only sites. I prefer [Waterfox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org) which is Firefox configured to remove data/telemetry sent back to Mozilla. The go-to add ons are:* uBlock Origin* HTTPS Everywhere* Privacy BadgerThe last two are from [EFF](https://www.eff.org/pages/tools). If you’re comfortable with Firefox, then the above extensions are still a good compromise.	
8506	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
8507	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
8508	 Tutanota	 Thanks for the insight. We will look at the feature again and see if we can add a means to turn it on/off. You can also vote for features/modifications here: https://tutanota.uservoice.com/That being said, it is encrypted so no one can access the information. In the new client, you can also add a second factor to make sure no one else can access your account.Edit: We will also change this feature so that it logs the closed sessions only for a period of two weeks.	
8509	 AlpacaKid	 Forgive me for my ignorance, can Tor be a substitute for a VPN?I've downloaded the reddit app via F-Droid, a FOSS service that doesn't ask for my number. Would it still be okay to use the reddit app?Could you elaborate on things that I shouldn't post that might reveal things about myself? Do you mean things that clearly give away my personal identity?	
8510	 akunbaru	 use r/Firefox and change Default Search Engine to r/DuckDuckGodo it to every device you have, and if you can, use VPN and always using it whenever you connect to the Internet	
8511	 flipjargendy	 If you haven't tried, its not hard. Get a distro like Manjaro and put it on a bootable USB first. It will likely work out of the box. No "geeky" stuff.A few of my older friends (50s and 60s) were fed up with Windows 10/8 and asked me to install Linux. They love it and don't ask me for help anymore because things work and are easy to use.	
8512	 postlapsar	 Copperhead does everything you want. It installs without root and relocks the bootloader.  I recently broke mine and switched to a BB10 device. It seems also secure and I can sideload the Yalp store to get Protonmail and other important apps.    It does not support open VPN however and I couldn't get another VPN to work. Also no notifications for Protonmail, but some other android notifications work. Still, BB10 is great overall and very secure. But Copperhead is better overall. Both help to de-Google my life.EDIT: I forgot to mention Blackphone. It creates multiple VM-like workspaces. However, the phone itself was kind of clunky and security updates were slow if ever. I ended up selling mine after only a few weeks. I think even LineageOS is more secure.Then there is Sailfish, a mostly opensource Linux OS but has nearly no security. But if used correctly, it could make you a “ghost.” VPN works great and no tracking if you disable cell. In fact, not even the camera drivers work on mine - a bug or feature depending on how you look at it. 	
8513	 postlapsar	 On the other hand GV is very reliable and can forward calls to multiple phones, which makes it less likely to miss a call, even if you switch cell numbers. I think it is fine on your resume.	
8514	 Geminii27	 Enjoy Gitmo.	
8515	 mecaenas	 /r/ThatHappened	
8516	 postlapsar	 My biggest complaint about secure email is their lack of interoperability. You can't have easily encrypted conversations between PM tuta posteo etc because they all use different systems. In otherwords they only care about their business and not securing the internet. I still use them, but their mission of protecting communications is BS. 	
8517	 mecaenas	 Because people want computers to just work; they don't want to use a command line, and they don't want to get shat on by Linux nerds for asking simple questions online, then after the insults being told to use another distro.	
8518	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I don't know if they do or not, but I can say that you can create an account over Tor. I used a free openmailbox account to have an anonymous email address that I could use to create an anonymous protonmail account over Tor (using protonmail's email confirmation to activate the account since I could never get a captcha to work despite them working fine elsewhere). I also set the openmailbox account as my recovery email in case the protonmail account ever locks my account due to "an excessive number of login attempts" (has happened once before). Just FYI...	
8519	 Rustycage2015	 Thank you very much for your answer!I have actually just started using Firefox. Is Waterfox significantly different in design and function to Firefox?	
8520	 Rustycage2015	 This is going to sound awful to you, but what exactly is a VPN?	
8521	 Bc2CG8294Qcb	 Brave does out of the box the same things as Firefox with add-ons that people have recommended here. Both should suit your needs well, in the end it's about personal preference.	
8522	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
8523	 australian_user	 It’s identical, just a few versions behind. If you’re using the latest version of Firefox (the Quantum version) it might look a bit different. If you just got comfy with the latest version of Firefox I’d suggest just adding those extensions :)	
8524	 tum0ur	 How do you even stay privacy conscious if you have no idea how anything works? Do you just browse around with Chrome's incognito browser or something?Wait you can use tor and you play around with dark markets and the hidden wiki, you  just put yourself at the mercy of wherever you go there cause you blindly trust Tor and the onion operators?	
8525	 njtrafficsignshopper	 Erm, your bullshit aside, you're missing the point. This is written by people who purport to keep an eye on Facebook, not by Facebook.	
8526	 ghost3321	 Only use tor	
8527	 Rumbustificator	 I am not a geek and Linux Mint is supremely easily to install and get working with; possibly the easiest choice for someone looking to leave Windows behind. 	
8528	 akunbaru	 What is a VPN?VPN is an acronym for Virtual Private Network.A VPN is a network technology that creates a secure network connection over a public network such as the Internet or a private network owned by a service provider. Large corporations, educational institutions, and government agencies use VPN technology to enable remote users to securely connect to a private network.A VPN can connect multiple sites over a large distance just like a Wide Area Network (WAN). VPNs are often used to extend intranets worldwide to disseminate information and news to a wide user base. Educational institutions use VPNs to connect campuses that can be distributed across the country or around the world.In order to gain access to the private network, a user must be authenticated using a unique identification and a password. An authentication token is often used to gain access to a private network through a personal identification number (PIN) that a user must enter.VPN in the way we mean and use it is not that much different to the described way. We join a virtual private network from a VPN provider and get a not public routed IP and can access the internet through NAT (like adding default gateway to the VPN one). And for securing our connection they also do not log anything (&lt;- that's not standard, but should be with a good provider)- https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/wiki/index

8530	 tum0ur	 What do you do to defend against fingerprinting techniques?I don't really want to help you out at all but do you know that the Fed can do much worse things to you than Facebook, right?	
8531	 trnabout	 It is part of the United States constitution to require census participation. The main census is taken every 10 years. What you have is a small sample supplemental questionnaire. It’s used to detect trends in between the main census. Technically, the law isn’t on your side. However, it has Apsley nothing to do with you.

8533	 aXenoWhat	 Is the email legit? Hover your mouse over all the links and see if the last part of the URL is the legitimate domain. Don't be fooled by something like "help.tillys-service.com". "Gfsjffjff.gjfcjgfvjhdfjdd.net" is right out.An important thing to be aware of is that with a small amount of know-how, someone can send an email that appears to be from someone else. Often the email is bait to get the recipient to click a link in the email.Number 1 thing IMO is not to use the same password or even similar passwords on multiple sites.IMO this is likely some dolt with a similar email address to yours, getting confused. Attackers tend to try high-value account logins like Apple or Facebook. IDK what Tilly's is but it doesn't sound like the most obvious way to monetise identity theft.	
8534	 TechnoSam_Belpois	 I mean, everyone's SSN is out there after the equifax hack anyway, so what does it matter at this point?	
8535	 kyotogold	 It's just the tip, what could it hurt?	
8536	 ghost3321	 I didn't grow up with computers and internet, I'm quite old, so I dont know much at all about tech stuff... But everywhere I turn there seems to be someone getting scammed or worse...So I don't use internet much at all, and there's no connection at all between my real person and anything I do online, not via  wifi spots or even emails etc., my devices or even phone number.I know that kind of cripples me a bit since almost everything in todays life is connected to internet... But since I'm not so savvy in the tech world I rather stay out of it mostly... 	
8537	 ghost3321	 I don't use anything where my fingerprint is required...Also I'm not from America, or even a english speaking country...	
8538	 DJRWolf	 Really? I have never looked at the store before so I will have to check that out. Thank you for the information.	
8539	 postlapsar	 Outrageous and disgusting? - Hmmm. You said it is a beta client. You realized that beta means testing. It does not mean that this "feature" will be in the final update, so your reaction seems a bit strong. Beta software is a place to work out the bugs and explain new features. The idea of having a choice is a good one. I think some people might want this feature and others not. I think Protonmail has this as an option also. 	
8540	 DNZ_not_DMZ	 [Read the full thing, it’s freaking amazing.](https://njal.la/blog/about-those-threats/)

8543	 OpinionKangaroo	 i would like to know if the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) will change anything in europe. i mean if it can cost you money to send sensitive information out without encryption it might bring some companys to offering encryption. (or i'm just wayyyyy to optimistic lol)	
8544	 gregorygains	 Thank you for that	
8545	 FeatheryAsshole	 definitely too optimistic! i'll be very surprised if that has wide consequences.	
8546	 giltwist	 I will look into that too, thank you.	
8547	 sevengali	 &gt;Forgive me for my ignorance, can Tor be a substitute for a VPN?Tor works kind of like a chain of VPNs. You could substitute it, but it's painfully slow.&gt; Do you mean things that clearly give away my personal identity?Doesn't even need to be clearly giving it away. Even "innocent" data can be collected together and eventually used to identify you if there's enough of it.	
8548	 anejole	 I agree here, Mint is very easy for most people who are just doing basic computer stuff (not anything specialized)

8551	 tn47	 &gt; But that's me. Enjoy your distro.I do. Thanks!	
8552	 iwannabethecyberguy	 You can store data online, but you'll want it encrypted.1. [rclone](https://rclone.org/) is a command-line tool, but not too hard to use if you give yourself some time to play with it. It lets you sync data from your computer to a cloud service with an encryption option.2. [Cryptomator](https://cryptomator.org/) is the same concept as rclone (send data to cloud encrypted) but as a GUI so it's a lot more user friendly. I personally don't like a few things about it, but it's a good start to encrypting your data online.3. [Sync.com](https://www.sync.com/) is like a regular cloud service, except everything is already encrypted when you upload it so you don't have to worry about doing it yourself. Just use it like you would Dropbox, Google Drive, etc. Most users on /r/privacy may not care for this since it's not open source.For offline, you can still use rclone or Crytpomator and point them to a hard drive, or you can use [VeraCrypt](https://veracrypt.codeplex.com/).After you do your research and have any interest in these, let me know and I can answer any questions or help you out.	
8553	 thibaultmartin	 I personally rent a VPS (at Kimsufi, they have competitive pricing for large amount of storage), on which I installed a Nextcloud instance.I backup my files using their WebDAV connector, use it to store my calendars using CalDAV, my contacts using CarDAV. I also use their app on my Android Phone (No Google Apps, retrieved from F-Droid). The app also auto-sends my photos to my Nextcloud instance whenever I shoot it using my phone.It works great, and has some advantages:* I don't have to trust any provider, apart from my VPS provider* Everything is Open Source* Nextcloud offers encryption (which I do use, and the performance are still very acceptable). The v12 stores the encryption key server-side, but v13 will ofer end-to-end encryption (server agnostic)* If my place burns down to ashes, I lose neither my documents nor photosBut setting up a Nextcloud instance requires a bit of work, and can be dangerous if you don't maintain properly your server/VPS. An insecure VPS with all your important files open on the internet is a great threat for your privacy.	
8554	 ABaseDePopopopop	 You should do both, if you really care about that data. It's generally considered good practice to have your data on 3 storages, including 1 that's physically in a different place. If you only put it in 2 places (the original and 1 backup), the backup should be in a physically different location.That is to protect from threats based on location. Things like burglary, floods, fire…The advantage of using online backup is that it fulfills the need for another location, and is easy to access. The drawback is that it takes some set-up, and you probably have to pay for it monthly/annually (unless it's really a small amount of data).An alternative is to store the data on a drive (or maybe DVDs) in a different place, yourself. For instance have an external drive at your workplace, or a collection of CDs at your parents' place.The advantage is that it's simple to set up, and cheaper. The drawback is that you have to manually bring it over to make the backup. Also you can't do as regular of a backup, so your most recent documents aren't protected properly.In any case that's not really linked to privacy. Any of those backups should be encrypted anyway.On the particular tool to use, or to help with set up, we can advise you. But it depends what you prefer to do.	
8555	 TopMosby	 not your fingerprint, the fingerprint of your browser.	
8556	 XTXm1x6qg7TM	 &gt;Haha, the NSA can't find me. I turned Hola VPN and Incognito on!	
8557	 postlapsar	 Well, technically Android and Chromebooks are Linux and they are easy as pie. I think most people use Linux more than windows without even realizing it. Those who don't, use Unix (OSX, iOS, BB10, WebOS, most IoT devices, etc.). All of the them "just work."

I know there are some that are supposed to work for red light/traffic cameras, but not sure if they work for readers as well or if anyone has developed anything to foil readers. Further, not sure how legal would be to use.	
8564	 2002_Nokia_Burner	 What are you trying to achieve with this project? Your question is very open ended and just emailing GG asking his views on privacy will not yield anything. Are you trying to educate yourself or the general public? The more specific you are, the more feedback you will get here. Good luck! 	
8565	 Everiet	 You're right. I trying to to figure it out here..It would be to educate the general public, most definitely. I think a lot of people have an idea but a lot don't realise how much of our privacy we are losing. I hope to share insights on how cautious we should be when sharing personal information online. To show how vulnerable we really are when it comes to using the internet even when using a search engine. 	
8566	 ghani256	 It would be nice if you could recommend some relatively inexpensive online services. I do not require much storage, only on the order of 5-6GB. How is Backblaze for starters?

I don't know if that's still the case, but it wouldn't take long for the camera manufacturers to deal with if too many people started doing it. An IR emitter has the advantage of not visibly obscuring the plate, although a judge might interpret 'obscuring' in a camera friendly way.

8585	 potatoclip	 Sure. I was re-reading the post and one more thing occured to me: OpenSSH server probably features backwards compatibility when multiple public keys exist in `/etc/ssh/`, and a few of those (including age old DSA keys) are generated when you install `openssh-server` packet. So make sure to remove all existing keys with `sudo rm -r /etc/ssh/ssh_host_*`  and then generating the type of key key you want. One of the pre-generated keys is ed25519 key though, so alternatively you can also remove everything except that type of key.

8590	 saghul	 Hi! Jitsi dev here. You are not wrong.(long story short) At present time WebRTC does not support a model for E2E encryption for groups calls. For 1-1 calls it is achievable, but you'd need to compare long hex fingerprints in a secure manner, so it's not ideal.We, and the broader IETF community are working on improving this in the PERC working group: https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/perc/documents/ Parts of Jitsi already have some PERC in them and some proofs of concept have been made with a modified Chromium version.Edit: here is the video of a talk about this, by a colleague and Jitsi dev: https://youtu.be/AJWAWZOt5u4?t=1087	
8591	 starrychloe	 Of course I did. That's why it wouldn't make sense to suggest family use Telegram if family doesn't care about encryption. What's the point of directing family to Telegram when it's not 'encrypted' anyways? You gain nothing from it, except a false sense of security. I know I could never get _my_ family to use another app besides SMS so why bother with Telegram?

I'm confused how the OS will affect what VPN protocols will run. If true, this seems to be a deal breaker?

8613	 jamcar23	 It's one thing to buy standard sized clothes online (which I don't do) but it's another thing to uses cameras, and in some cases 3D scanners, to measure every part of your body for custom sized clothes. If this data was taken by a doctor or hospital it would be considered sensitive medical data protected by HIPAA, but because it's taken by a retail store there aren't any legal requirements for privacy. These stores can do anything with your data including, but not limited to, selling it or storing in an unencrypted database. I'm sure insurance companies and others would be extremely interested in purchasing medical-like data that isn't protected by HIPAA. These new companies are doing so well from this tech that other major retail stores, like Macy's, are already looking at how they can leverage this technology too. How long until they start putting cameras / 3D scanners in their stores to tell you if the clothes fit / look good on you? This is just the beginning of companies profiting off of our body's data. Over time I think it's going to be more and more popular with stores and more and more invasive to the consumer, which is why I think this is a bleak look at the _future_.

Do you mean things that clearly give away my personal identity?Language and punctuation patterns, window/screen sizes, mouse movement, brightness settings, scroll patterns, how long you view particular content, click patterns, and most other metadata can be used to deanonymize or identify you. Some of these threats can be minimized/eliminated with technical solutions such as TOR, but you still have to be wary about your usage patterns. It is incredibly difficult to maintain 100% anonymity, especially considering you listed government agencies as a potential concern.

8644	 ItsInTheOtherHand	 3. There is a very easy way around this. If you are masking/redaction an image for privacy/security reasons and then uploading it, *never used that modified image* - only a screenshot.  - E.X. You start out with some document that has names, images, micro-dpts, etc that you want to remove. Crop out the images, black bar the names, overwrite the micro printing, etc. And save the fuel. Then, *take a screenshot* of the redacted  image. Now those edits are an intrinsic part of the image, and (If you covered everything properly) the stuff you obscuresd can never be revealed. Then upload that screenshot.	
8645	 ItsInTheOtherHand	 &gt;* don't use the reddit app use your browser instead because the app will be tied to your Google or apple play store account which will be tied to your pH numberUnless you're using an F-Droid app like RedReader. It even has an experimental Tor setting.

8656	 postlapsar	 OpenVPN works fine. I was talking about another OS.Many apps work fine without google services even if they say they need it . I just ignore the warning popups.Yes it installs fine using the supplied script. I haven't installed Copperhead for awhile, but I imagine it temporarily unlocks the bootloader, installs and then relocks it. Either way you end up with a very secure Android with no root, locked bootloader, and no Google. The official store is FDroid.

8666	 TotalMelancholy	 anyone who cares about privacy should be using an adblocker	
8667	 iwannabethecyberguy	 Decentraleyes has local versions of popular JavaScript files such as JQuery. Typically you would download the script on a website that uses it, which typically use a CDN (like Google's CDN) to download the script. Decentraleyes nullifies that and uses it's own version so you don't communicate with Google's CDN servers (for privacy) while also protecting from modified scripts that may have been infected while also somewhat saving on bandwidth. ELI5: You go to a party (website) and someone (Google CDN) hands you a drink (JavaScript). "Here you'll need this." You don't trust that you don't know where it came from, so you say "That's OK, I've already got one" showing them the drink you brought (Decentraleyes.)Hopefully that helps. I'll try to come up with a better example.

8669	 geominded	 yea, but giving consent to be recorded isn't the same as giving consent for a company to publish personal details. Especially when that info is your SSN number and home address.	
8670	 OnlyWallsOfText	 A lot of websites (including Reddit) essentially outsource parts of each page to large companies like Amazon and Google as those companies have servers ([CDNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)) all over the world, which means pages load faster.A lot of things are delivered through CDNs, whether you know it or not.The issue is that when you visit a page which needs something from those servers, there is information at the end of the link to say what website you are on, what page you're on, etc. The CDN server usually stores this information and uses it for their own good.Essentially, it gives those companies more information about you to sell, and to track you with. It doesn't matter if you have blocked trackers, ads, cookies, etc, as this is different.CDNs are absolutely essential in the modern internet as fast content delivery needs lots of servers all over the world, which only large companies can really do, so you need a compromise - strip out the unnecessary, without stopping the necessary from working;Decentraleyes strips the website identifying information from the ends of the CDN referral, so it doesn't know what website you were on. It also caches regularly used files on your computer, and when it does, your computer does not need to send information to the CDN; instead, it uses the local cache.This speeds up the loading of pages on your computer (at the cost of a very low amount hard-drive space), while increasing your privacy.Modern browsers **do** cache CDN files themselves, but the issue is they still contact the CDN to ask if the file has been updated (it's very rare for this to actually happen).

8678	 No-User-Name	 Unless you want to support a particular YouTuber, participate in a live chat or comment use HookTube instead... just replace any video link with ~~youtube~~ hooktube - someone here recommended this a while back and I've now fully transitioned off YouTube. benefits being there's no ads whatsoever which is great for Tor browser users, the only caveat being the search function is mediocre.

8688	 onlyonebyte	 If you're ever considering to switch to Linux, I'd recommend LUKS. You can set it up with a couple clicks during installation and have full-disk encryption from the get go.

8690	 Youknowimtheman	 You are aware that any good software encryption is going to have a reasonably large performance hit? That does seem to be larger than usual though. Are you using the triple-layer nested encryption?If performance is a concern, maybe dial it back to just one layer.	
8691	 DecentralizedPeer	 I don't think they'll put the notes on the servers unencrypted.  But I don't know how this is of any importance at all since Evernote might just read your stuff anyway.I guess it makes Evernote a little worse than it already is when it comes to privacy.

8698	 Hationts1943	 &gt; Anxiety about it is indeed growing, but from a low base. The Chinese word for privacy, yinsi, has a negative connotation of secrecy.... and that's the narrative people are trying to spread here, too. privacy = you must have something bad to hide

8733	 dontsyncjustride	 what should be the biggest worry to a privacy conscious person, in my professional opinion, should not be search engines, but websites with ads. (ads that, lol, quote unquote 'track' you. because that's where we get all our data on ips, dev ids, x/y/z, etc., not Google or Yahoo!.)pre-edit: as far as i know: no, SSNs, DOB, or any other PII is transferred in these networks. it would be very illegal to target an individual and store data with the purposes of extracting PII such as an SSN. Realistically, only hackers are after that and it's much easier to get than going through the ad-nets.

8743	 xSiNNx	 Just a guess: they change and are updated regularly (some probably multiple times a week), so shipping an OS with them for example just wouldn’t work. You need the new version, or the one that works for the page you are loading, and that requires a central repository of some sort. I think what this does is locally stores those scripts and replaces them as they’re updated, but I really have no clue. 	
8744	 btcltcbch	 what do you do for the android youtube app?	
8745	 sting_12345	 yeah copperheadOS is probably a bit more hardened than lineageOS I agree.

Do they also use MicroG in their system?  How do they handle google apps and Google Play Services?	
8746	 Synist0r	 Would you mind sharing it, please?	
8747	 AlpacaKid	 I don't know what MicroG is. I never bothered with Google services but recently I wanted to use the Brave browser, which isn't available on Copperhead's Appstore, F-Droid, so I downloaded Yalk Store via F-Droid. Seems to work well.

8774	 different55	 Cry yourself to sleep. Or use NewPipe on FDroid	
8775	 misconfig_exe	 Pi-Hole does not block malicious scripts, only blacklisted domains. If a malicious script comes from a trusted domain, it can still compromise you.In my experience it is also very hit-or-miss in blocking YouTube ads. Seems to work against tv.youtube.com but not on the Android mobile app	
8776	 misconfig_exe	 NoScript, properly managed, is probably the overall best single add-on protection. But it requires a lot to manage and is only one layer.A multi-layered approach is best.

8801	 sting_12345	 Yeah microG is lineageos but instead of gapps which require a Google account and all their bloated Spyware. They use a custom service that allows the yalp store to download any app from Google play store without having play store or play services. They built a special api that allows all your apps to run Google play services but totally anonymously. Their build and apps get updated thru the fdroid store repository so it's all in one. Also they have another api for location services if you want to activate it and get greater control of your info too.https://lineage.microg.orgThey have everything pre-built in one flash so you don't need to compile or install things but one time and they have just about every model phone there to download. It'd really great, the convenience of play store without having Google monitor your life.

8804	 AlpacaKid	 Good answer thanks. Is MicroG related to Yalp store?	
8805	 sting_12345	 I don't know if they are the same person but microG definitely depends on it for their access to play store apps. I think you can just run yalp though on any phone or room.

8808	 BlueZarex	 Which would only protect this guy when he is at home and his iPhone is on WiFi.	
8809	 No-User-Name	 Follow the F-Droid and Yalp Store suggestion for Google app installs if possible.I recommend the following alternatives or suggestions,Look into ProtonMail for a more private email service.Replace Accuweather asap. look into Forecastie, or bookmarking Darksky.net is also a good option.Replace the Samsung Browser ASAP with DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser, or Firefox Focus.Consider trying and ideally replacing Messenger lite and or Text now with the Wire privacy messenger.I don't use or are too familiar with the rest of the apps, so you're likely making a compromise for conveniences as we all do so I recommend you also consider installing the Permission Friendly App, it gives a privacy score for your installed applications and the permissions list they ask for, so you can make an educated guess on finding alternative replacements. (I believe ProtonMail and DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser currently require Google play services but are far better choices).Edit - DuckDuckGo Privacy Browser has no dependencies on Google play services but Firefox Focus does, so in the latter case Firefox Klar from the F-Droid depository  is a better privacy alternative.	
8810	 JeffersonsSpirit	 If any of you want to cry, check out the comments on the thread in /r/news:https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7t4ha5/ice_is_about_to_start_tracking_license_plates/Its worth reading because there is some really scary shit listed from a privacy perspective.I think its interesting too how many people in that thread are demonstrating that they care about privacy, that this (and many other) forms of privacy invasion are scary, and that where possible they're willing to go to great lengths to preserve privacy.I have to wonder sometimes if in fact Americans concerned about privacy aren't a small minority, but instead perhaps a large minority or more. Technology has been harnessed in a way and rammed down our throats in a way that we often feel alone, but maybe we're not- maybe we are being led to believe we are because that prevents us from acting in unison to protect our rights. I could be wrong of course- its impossibly complicated and as of yet there is no real way to know for sure.One thing is in our favor though- it is *fact* that the majority of Americans aren't content with our systems. They have different reasons for that discontent, different levels of concern, and different ideas of what needs to happen to fix our issues, but I am convinced the *majority* is brooding with contempt for how little power they have over their own lives. It may never happen, but if one day *something* catalyzes and we become united in taking back our rights, the response will shock (and change) the world.	
8811	 Typhron	 I'm not a racist. Also, my primary browsing experience does not rotate around actual politics; let alone slanderhouses, fake shit, and people who unironically can't take a joke. Also, my primary browsing experience usually contains content that isn't stale. Also, I respect myself.So, how 'bout them alternatives? 	
8812	 misconfig_exe	 That's my lineup as well, but with μBlock Origin instead of ABP. I turn telemetry off even for those addons, and use Firefox for almost all of my general browsing. For school and stuff like that I use Chrome with the same addons but I don't enable NoScript, because I only go to trusted sites with Chrome (sites that I know Google at least is going to be tracking me to and from) and I have μBlock and Ghostery on to block third party trackers and ad scripts at the browser level.But that's just the browser layer. In my quest to limit my exposure to malicious ads, privacy-invading trackers, and generally keep my shit secure, I use a multi-layered approach.I run a Pi-Hole with multiple blacklists that contain known malicious domains, C2C servers, malware distributors, and spam addresses, in addition to blocking ads. I then send my outward (non-pi-holed) DNS requests out to [Quad9](https://www.globalcyberalliance.org/initiatives/quad9.html) which checks for known malicious domains and checks their constantly growing threat database.And then of course there are other network-level and OS-level protections too.

8817	 Nefandi	 To disable most miners I think one needs something like uMatrix (in addition to uBlock Origin).  In uMatrix, there is a setting called "forbid web workers" and that should do the trick.  It also disables sites like mega, unfortunately.	
8818	 ZugNachPankow	 I'm not sure it would be great for privacy - you are disclosing your viewing habits to an additional third party.

8828	 ApocalypseOfLlamas	 You're exactly the same as those idiots who don't use Firefox because Mozilla donated to riseup. Grow up, christ. You aren't being forced to use Voat just because they support it, and neither does that mean you are supporting Voat by using the website.Besides all that, the voat website itself is not racist - it was designed to be censorship free, unlike Reddit, the problem being that people are lazy and lack initiative to switch platform so Voat quickly filled up with only those who were banned from reddit (e.g. gamer-gaters) and gained a reputation for racism.

8834	 1nfiniteJest	 It's 'safe' if you know what you're doing. But it's a very powerful tool. Unchecking a single box could potentially cause serious problems with your PC. Just look up anything before you toggle it on/off. It pretty much gives you access to all OS settings in a simple, checkbox format. Treat it with the respect it deserves

And just please. Backup your data regularly. Don’t say you will. Or say you do and forget. Do it. Do it now. Do it next week also. I’ve never met a man who lost his data who was upset at himself for backing up. If you would be upset if someone stole your hard drive. It’s worth backing it up. 	
8837	 HanoverWilliam	 Fuck that's clever.  	
8838	 n0tb8m8	 If you’ve tried all of those and not decided upon one, what are you hoping to find that they do not offer?Is it a lack of people you know (allegedly) irl using the platforms?I found it difficult to convince people to use yet another chat application (Signal) to communicate with me as I refused to use WhatsApp or anything else.If it is for this reason, imho best you can do is educate them without preaching at them.

8844	 1093bcf14dui5	 If you know that you can't disable W10 spying, then you should always assume someone has complete control over your computer and has access to everything you do.If you use it for nothing more than gaming you should be fine.	
8845	 FeatheryAsshole	 What I do is never logging into anything except steam, and then only use my web browser for gaming-related content (i.e. gamefaqs and youtube). I don't have access to my data drive on Windows, either. If your gaming PC is your only computing device, that might be too annoying, though.	
8846	 Methmo	 You could have the RPi serve as a VPN alongside the pihole. Home IP changing will be a bit of a nuisance though.	
8847	 bluefish009	 it is impossible, use reactos or linux.	
8848	 Methmo	 Get a raspberry pi, and install r/pihole on it. Add blocklists for Windows telemetry, then set it as your PC's DNS server.If you use this for nothing other than PC gaming, you could even operate the pihole on a whitelist system, i.e. block everything except specific domains (such as steam servers and whatever your games require). This would make it nigh on impossible for Microsoft to spy on you, because it makes it almost impossible for Windows 10 to find MS servers. You would of course have to disable this when you want updates, though - but then again, you wouldn't really need many security updates if it is using this system.Edit: Assuming Windows doesn't hard-code its own DNS servers for its telemetry, which it might well do, in which case you'd have to monitor traffic from your PC and block the IP addresses of those servers. That might block Windows updates until you unblock the IP addresses though.***Or, you could run Windows 10 as a virtual machine on a linux host, with PCI passthrough on the GPUs to reach nearly native speed. This is not something I have done, and it sounds like a pain to set up, but having linux as the host OS would give you far greater control over Windows 10.	
8849	 Anoian	 I have a pi and i have configured a pihole but then youtube didnt work anymore as there was just a blank video that didnt stop when there should be an ad.Basically requests just never got a response, which fired stuff like DOMContentLoaded ridiculously late.Also the loading indicator on the side of the browser tab didnt stop moving when there was an ad on the page. (Which wasnt loaded of course.)The downsides outweight the upsides for me	
8850	 MelbCrypto	 Define strangely 	
8851	 -DementedAvenger-	 It’s totally up to you what sites and ads get blocked. You can whitelist (and blacklist) whatever domains you want.

8853	 555555300	 I've heard mixed things about ghostery, but I will do this finally.	
8854	 Eidbi	 Good and privacy-respecting Linux OS. No logging to Facebook or anything of the sorts ever. Create a new mail account on Tutanota. Don't use your old ones, or they will find you out. Use a good VPN which resides outside of your country. And which claims in their privacy policy that they don't log your activity. You may use Tor over VPN as well. Until you set up VPN properly, use Tor for everything. As unless you do, they'll find you out.Don't use Chrome. Ever. No Chromium as well. Tor is the only choice for privacy.Android and privacy are not compatible. You should backup all your data, then make a factory reset and install custom ROM, such as LineageOS, then you should NOT ever login to Google. And use orfox on LineageOS, as it is analogue of Tor there. Be sure to use only open-source apps, which don't require permissions for microphone, camera, contacts, sms, phone (etc), unless they really need it. Never post any personal information about yourself, ever.Be sure to setup your router. It doesn't matter how good your privacy is on your OS, if anyone can hack to your router. Check your model, and if it supports third-party firmware. Install open-source ones, and modify them for your privacy.Most importantly of them all. Don't **EVER** visit http sites. Everyone can see what you are doing here. Anyone can steal your data or manipulate it there. Be sure to only visit https sites. This way people can see what sites you visit, but have no idea what you are doing there.About forums: be sure to know EXACTLY what kind of forums you are visiting. If they have bad privacy policies, then contact them and explain why they should respect privacy. If they don't agree, don't listen to you, then tell them that you won't visit their forums anymore.	
8855	 Eidbi	 Download [W10Privacy] (https://www.winprivacy.de/english-home/), download [O&amp;O ShutUp 10] (https://www.oo-software.com/en/shutup10) Follow all the instructions. They state what exactly every function disables. After that install Peerblock, add a list with Microsoft - https://www.iblocklist.com/list?list=xshktygkujudfnjfioro Set it in settings, so that it autostarts with Windows. After that check what your router's model is, and if it supports third-party firmware like OpenWRT, DDWRT, etc. Backup your settings (Wan IP, Mac adress, etc), install third-party firmware, block all the same IPs from Microsoft list from above. This should be enough. You can use more tools like Blackbird, etc, to ensure that many of settings are disabled.If you want a W10 with better control and more privacy, then download and install W10 LTSB. And do all the same things, mentioned above.	
8856	 Hationts1943	 Sometimes we are. And note: I am part of _we_. I know that I also have an irrational fear of Google products sometimes.But for example, the Chrome browser is still the most secure browser given its sandboxing architecture and millions of dollars poured into engineering resources. They are just better suited $$$-wise, that's the reality.So, you know, nothing is ever black or white.ps. Also, ChromeOS is held in high regard in the security community.	
8857	 Eidbi	 The same is true for me.	
8858	 Eidbi	 Sad truth is it doesn't matter what OS you are using, as spying is done through sites. So the moment you visit Internet, you are screwed. You can block everything with uMatrix and NoScript, though. And use Tor over VPN.	
8859	 Hationts1943	 Or just flip over a switch in the settings and notice that nothing breaks. The only actually meaningful and not trying-to-profit-off-of-you thing that ever broke by disabling 3rd party cookies for me was Pocket's bookmarklet - understandably. So I whitelisted it and boom, it's all great.

8865	 postlapsar	 This is good news. CopperheadOS also has Fdroid baked in. Any others?	
8866	 thepaip	 Thank you, this is helpful.I can't use W10 LTSB since NVIDIA Drivers won't install over there.	
8867	 Youknowimtheman	 You do say secondary SSD, is this on the same physical drive or is it a physical 2nd SSD? Also are you using any type of virtualization?That performance hit seems large for one pass of AES.	
8868	 postlapsar	 Whatsapp is like FB in 2007, only encrypted. I know someone who uses Telegram because all HER friends use it.  She has both, so she can communicate between social groups. These apps keep you connected without all the news feed crap and ads.	
8869	 akunbaru	 I prefer r/signal, WhatsApp is Closed Source, see right sidebar &gt; The promotion of closed source privacy software is not welcome in /r/privacy. By its nature you can not verify easily that it does what it claims and as a result this puts your privacy and security at risk	
8870	 Eidbi	 The entire functionality of Disconnect can be enabled in uBlock Origin by simply enabling Disconnect list. There are many more lists in uBlock Origin, so it offers way more in terms of functionality.	
8871	 Eidbi	 It was [him] (https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7lmk6v/hooktube_the_new_youtube_that_we_should_all_be/) and [me] (https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7oj9hj/hooktube_redirect/).	
8872	 Eidbi	 Well, unless you visit a site, created with privacy in mind, you are disclosing it anyway.	
8873	 Eidbi	 &gt;  In fact, dare I say it, it’s easier to block ads on iPhone than it is on Android,It really isn't. &gt;especially when you have to download an extra browser.Chrome on Android is garbage anyway. No one who respects himself/herself should use it. It doesn't even support extensions.	
8874	 Eidbi	 It had ads in videos for a while. Ads with miners is new kind of awful though.	
8875	 Eidbi	 Mega only works on Chromium forks, sadly.	
8876	 Eidbi	 No, anyone who cares about privacy should be using a content blocker, like uBlock Origin. Adblockers alone have way little functionality to protect people from tracking scripts.	
8877	 Eidbi	 Not using third-party cookies doesn't break anything. If sites can't allow you to login without using third-party cookies, then they should not be trusted or visited at all. It's not about breaking the web, it is about breaking the browser to fit the flawed web.Also Brave has third-party cookies disabled by default.	
8878	 Eidbi	 &gt;I can't use W10 LTSB since NVIDIA Drivers won't install over there.Interesting. I had no problems with installing drivers for W10 LTSB, but I have an AMD video-card. Can you try installing drivers through EasyDrive program? I wasn't able to install video drivers on another installation of W10 (non LTSB), but after using this program, I was able to do it.	
8879	 G4ME	 VPN into home network ...

8884	 loosedata	 There are real forces that can prevent someone from switching OS or software such as money, occupation or situation. I could not have passed Uni without a Windows OS, I didn't have the money for a second machine, and my Uni only communicated through Facebook. Despite that there's still plenty of steps you can take to improve your privacy but this subreddit often takes an all or nothing approach to security which isn't very compatible with the real world. 	
8885	 Eidbi	 &gt;AdBlockChange this to uBlock Origin, Adblock Plus (or Adblock) doesn't itself block tracking scripts, it only blocks ads. So it allows tracking you through the net.&gt;Even after grabbing a new IP address, restarting my browser (Firefox)Firefox uses Google Analytics, which may be used to track you.Have you tried to delete all your data from Firefox and THEN changing your IP address? Because if you simply change IP, they may track you through other means.It can also be a case of IP leak. By default WebRTC is enabled in Firefox, but  it can cause your real IP to leak, regardless if you use VPN or Tor or proxy. Check, if your IP is leaked here - https://www.privacytools.io/#webrtcMy advice is to not use Firefox at all, and rather use Brave (open-source browser, developed by co-founder of Mozilla), which is made with privacy in mind. If you still want to use Firefox, then try to setup it by this instruction - https://www.privacytools.io/#about_config

8889	 T5UV9UCI5Q5S3J9	 &gt; Our privacy is dying, and that's OK (probably) *Not!*&gt; Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say. - [Snowden](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/36ru89/just_days_left_to_kill_mass_surveillance_under/crglgh2)	
8890	 cas18khash	 It's be worst that watching paint dry. I've tried these Monero charity miners on the browser and it literally takes hours to mine a fraction of 100th of a dollar	
8891	 Eidbi	 &gt;How can I make my laptop hack-proof?Tor doesn't make your laptop hack-proof. If you want to make your laptop hack-proof, install secured sandboxed OS, like Qubes OS and use sandboxed Tor there.	
8892	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 And even cash is traceable and they have batch number codes and serial numbers to track the journey a note makes and who circulated it and where.	
8893	 T5UV9UCI5Q5S3J9	 &gt; At home we use a streaming service that sometimes serves ads for other things but mostly just for their own shows. If you have an "app" on your phone that has microphone permissions, it is technically possible to correlate the data to ads on your streaming account. Especially if you are referring to NetFlix or Hulu on both the phone and the stream box.In order to test the theory you can mess up the algorithm by talking about babies or some totally random medical condition (not a real one that you have for privacy purposes) and see if you get targeted ads.

8896	 T5UV9UCI5Q5S3J9	 If you want to be able to use Engimail or K-9, you need a non-webmail only e-mail. Limited selection, but Autisici and Cadamail come to mind, since both allow Tor should you need it.	
8897	 Eidbi	 Chrome is not even close to being the most secure browser. It has two functionalities with hundreds of vulnerabilities built-in in itself ([Flash plugin] (https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-53/product_id-6761/Adobe-Flash-Player.html) and [Pdf viewer] (https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-17/materials/asia-17-Liu-Dig-Into-The-Attack-Surface-Of-PDF-And-Gain-100-CVEs-In-1-Year-wp.pdf) )Chromium has neither of them, so it is way better for security. It takes Chrome more than a freaking month to update itself to a new version. Chromium is updated **way** more often. So Chrome should **not** ever be recommended for security, ever.	
8898	 ScrantonPartyy	 I had a Google home for a while. We basically only used it as a cooking timer and music player. They are waaayyyy over hyped. Even for home automation, there are apps to control that stuff.	
8899	 T5UV9UCI5Q5S3J9	 &gt; you can’t be a private AirBnB guest or a private eBay sellerWriter obviously doesn't know about using cash-only at random Motels, using old cars, or using Stealth eBay accounts. There's of course r/OpenBazaar which is far superior to eBay as well.Privacy and transparency cannot coexist. You can compartmentalize your privacy depending on your threat level.	
8900	 Eidbi	 &gt;predictive analytics can reduce dropout ratesLaugh. Dropout happens because educational system does not give a single shit about **personalities** of students. You can't force everyone to do the same shit. People have different understanding of the world, different ways to remember stuff, different interests. Until people understand that you can't create a single educational system, directed at everyone, and that any person needs individual way of getting to him, the education will be shit and people will have no will to learn anything at all.

With a revelations of [YouTube using crypto-miners now] (https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/01/now-even-youtube-serves-ads-with-cpu-draining-cryptocurrency-miners/), there is many reasons to use Hooktube instead.

8905	 Paranoidsbible	 Author didn't really dig into this topic, did they? I mean, their excuse of transparency and connected tech fails to even take into consideration how many people are abandoning smart phones, smart tech and social media. I'm not even talking about the privacy community or paranoid individuals.People are feeling exhausted with the constant leaks, database drops and digital break-ins. They're tired of upgrades and updates. They're tired of censorship too. People are changing, albeit slowly, and liking more simple, private solutions.Even with that said, and it being a small change (for now), there are hundreds of communities and websites doing cash-only deals and sales. You also have the explosion of groups and individuals creating privacy-based guides ([an example being the group I help with](https://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/library)), websites and communities.There'll always be a way to circumvent modern tech and trends for a more private life.	
8906	 314420314	 Check out uMatrix is the better Noscript  	
8907	 Paranoidsbible	 The sub may have a rigid pool of recommended steps, however that isn't the entire sub. A lot of people push alternatives or guides, or even try to find different solutions. I mean, I do tend to over do it with linking to my group's [guides](https://paranoidsbible.tumblr.com/library) and reccomending baby steps. There are also those who actively push "beginner" routines, like preventing dox and lessening your digital footprint (I'm actually one of those people).While change is good and you do need to be welcoming of the uninitiated, you also can't just change everything about the community and hope everyone starts being privacy conscious due to being more inclusive. Some people will take it as a sign to push for relaxed options or push things like "Well Facebook isn't that bad."Yeah, people can be a bit abrasive but a lot of people can be lazy too. If you can't step back and lurk a bit, don't expect people to just hand you solutions. A lot of people need to take up some self-study and research. Not saying I don't support inclusiveness or people being more open to different solutions... just... if you want change, you have to be said change, and that people can't always rely on others or the community to carry them.

8909	 mrchaotica	 What does noscript do that ublock + umatrix don't?	
8910	 jrwren	 well that isn't true, it does matter what OS you are using, especially if you never use a web browser	
8911	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 &gt; Privacy and transparency cannot coexist.Yes but you can have a separate laptop with Qubes+Whonix on it that you use for private stuff, and a Chromebook for more transparent stuff. All that's needed is to be careful not to confuse two different working environments. For example, don't visit a darknet market and then Google for your legal name in the same browsing session on the same laptop.

8922	 DemIce	 I've always wondered what nations, or cities, or smallvilles, other projects amount to.   E.g. GIMPS, folding, SETI, etc. which carry a huge overhead by running on desktops, laptops, rpis, and so on vs dedicated clusters.( not getting into utility arguments where bitcoin is 'just a ponzi scheme' while folding 'saves lives' - just curious about estimates of numbers )

8926	 Eidbi	 &gt;Nearly the entire economy is geared to convince you that your data really doesn’t need to be private, and that you should freely share it.Brilliant quote. It is exactly the reason why a lot of people don't understand that they need privacy.

8930	 Eidbi	 &gt;* Don't take risks with your primary PC. Restrict social media browsing to cell phones, tablets, and secondary PCs.This on the other hand is a horrible advice. Your phone contains your messages, phone contacts and other personal information. Considering that the OS which powers majority of phones and tablets is Android, the OS, which is existing by garnering your data, this should not be recommended at all.

8936	 IsopropylWick	 Part of the reason there are no estimates on how much power the advertising industry consumes is because it's too big.Yes btc uses a lot of power.

8940	 Sunimaru	 No such permissions for any streaming apps on the phone. Except for a few apps those are all locked up properly and web access is also restricted with a firewall for things that shouldn't need it. I can only think of one app that actually has both microphone and network access.We often talk about stuff we want to buy, medical stuff, well basically anything, in the presence of or over our phones. So you could say that we've already been running that experiment continuously. The only times obviously targeted ads have showed up so far have been when it's something we've searched for from the TV, like specific computer parts or kitchen stuff. Things that we've talked quite a bit about but never searched for, like a certain location we're considering moving to, the very specific birthday present we're thinking about getting for my father, or baby related stuff, have never appeared.I guess one possible experiment format would be to pick two different groups of fake subjects and then talk with the spouse about one of them and about the other with my Toyota friend.	
8941	 Eidbi	 No problem. I just got a name for one program wrong, as well.

8948	 loosedata	 The increase of privacy for web browsing is negilble between OS's. Once Windows is on my machine I'm not going to gain anymore privacy by switching to a Linux usb to use Firefox.My hardware, a nvidia GPU, also wouldn't play nice with Linux, especially at the time.	
8949	 btcltcbch	 I already use pi-hole so I don't think that extra hosts in my host file would help, but adaway might (the android devices that use the youtube-app are wi-fi only) ...I'm going to try NewPipe or Skytube as suggested by the other comments

8952	 Eidbi	 &gt; Once Windows is on my machine I'm not going to gain anymore privacy by switching to a Linux usb to use Firefox.Em... It doesn't matter if Windows is on your machine. As long as you don't do anything important in it, and literally use other OS to do important stuff, Microsoft won't learn anything you do on another OS. They have no control over it. It is not also about privacy, it is about convenience. It is not convenient to do everything in Windows. Windows gets ridiculously slow with a time. Having another installation of even Windows (either on hard drive or USB) helps a lot. You don't have to remove your Windows installation, and still can access all of your files. Using Linux completely avoids problem, as Linux uses ext4 file system, which avoids fragmentation problem mostly. Browsing is way faster, running files is way faster, opening programs is way faster... Well, everything is way faster. And with no risks to privacy. As long as you use good privacy-respecting distro.You are right about not gaining privacy by using Firefox at all. As Firefox has to be heavily configured to get privacy by instruction here - https://www.privacytools.io/#about_config As by default it allows third-party cookies, hence lets advertisers, scammers and criminals following your every move on the internet by using tracking scripts, it uses Google as default search engine, hence gives Google access to all your private information, it connects to Google Analytics through Iframe, which leads to Mozilla site, and gives access to your data to Pocket, if you use it. Pocket then sells usage data to advertizers and may share your personal data with third parties, or with... anyone, if they wish to.You need to install uBlock Origin and to mess with settings, including about:config just to disable some of it. Even then Firefox still can access your microphone and camera. Not to mention that by using Firefox you are easier to fingerprint, as majority use Chrome. And by modifying Firefox and installing extensions you are even easier to fingerprint.

8955	 Samantion	 How can an ad be mining? Isn’t it just a video?	
8956	 thrower65	 I think a custom ROM on a non cellular tablet would be just as good as running a Linux distro on a PC.Even a custom ROM without Google on a phone is better than stock.	
8957	 mariusfb	 Yeah it works on W10. It doesn't use Windows Firewall rules (you have to disable it to use simplewall), it's another layer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Filtering_Platform&gt; Microsoft intended WFP for use by firewalls and by other packet-processing or connection-monitoring components, such as antivirus and antimalware software and parental controls. Additionally, WFP is used to implement NAT and to store IPSec policy configuration.The upcoming version, if I understand the commits correctly, will provide even more control but it's already great!	
8958	 Eidbi	 Yes. Custom ROM on a non cellular tablet is a as good as it gets, I agree.Everything is better than stock Android. As not only it is filled by a spyware from Google, it is filled by a spyware from carrier as well. A lot of them even pre-install facebook application (are they insane, or what?)	
8959	 Eidbi	 &gt; I mean Firefox is the same program whatever the OS. Windows tracking doesn't interact with it.While it is true, it is worth noting, that sandboxing was added in Linux version before Windows, so Linux users were safer by using Firefox for a while :)It depends on machine a lot. In my experience in all laptops and on dekstop I tried Linux distros are way faster and stable than Windows. While Windows 8 was horrible nightmare, which I would rather forget.	
8960	 Eidbi	 Great, thanks! Then this is exactly what I was searching for to secure (from Microsoft) my W10 LTSB. It is as if you've read my thoughts! I was even going to create a question about it here.	
8961	 glenskin90	 Thanks much! uBlock Origin solved the issue I brought up; but clearly I need to do a project to rethink and resecure my browser.	
8962	 mariusfb	 You can't trust any Windows software to completely block telemetry and data leaks since MS can change the floor under your feet without you knowing. You'll need something external to your machine using dedicated hardware, like pfsense.But looking at my router logs it did stop many calls, even Skype stopped working since they share some IPs.The data comes from https://github.com/crazy-max/WindowsSpyBlocker/wiki/dataSimplewall	
8963	 FullMetalBitch	 To be fair every search engine uses google/bing/yahoo anyway and the US probably doesn't give a fuck about where the service is located, also  duckduckgo have some amazing features like the answers when you are searching for programming or similar solutions,.I'm using Qwant right now but I still use ddg.

8967	 jcopeee22	 I have the same question. Wonder if a tech privy user could elaborate 	
8968	 mariusfb	 I think I tried all of the free options like WFC, TinyWall and Glasswire 1&amp;2 but they all depend on Windows Firewall, unlike simplewall, so they tend to have weird glitches if you have too many advanced rules (in my experience). Resource usage is also way better, Glasswire may have some nice UI and extra features but it's so god damn slow even when you disable disk write.(dunno why you got downvoted)	
8969	 PM_ME_UR_PHD_THESES	 That would break a good deal of websites btw.

8977	 Hationts1943	 I wanted to use Chromium on macOS but found that there is no up-to-date stable Chromium from a verifiable signed source that I could use unless I compile it myself which of course is highly impractical (it can take hours for a lousy notebook...)So if I wanted to go down that road I would either have to take someone's word that the official source is indeed what they compiled into their binary or I would need to use one of the gazillion forks that are either lagging in updates and are not regularly checked for trust by 3rd parties.According to my experience, the best bet to have Chromium's security features on macOS right now is either Brave or using Chrome and configuring it in a way to minimize Google intrusion (the latter of which is still questionable to me... They have a privacy white paper but ultimately, are you trusting the king of ads whose interests don't align with yours?)	
8978	 xxVb	 Maybe that's because cyber criminals going after your data is illegal, and you get some support from the legal system if your data is stolen. Corporations going after your data is just good business for them, and you get little to no support from the legal system when you're messing with business.	
8979	 francispelton	 delete your Facebook account and start calling your friends. 	
8980	 Eidbi	 &gt; According to my experience, the best bet to have Chromium's security features on macOS right now is either BraveThis is what I recommend. Other than Tor, Brave is probably the best browser with opt-out privacy. There is also Epic, which is closed-source though.&gt;the latter of which is still questionable to me... They have a privacy white paper but ultimately, are you trusting the king of ads whose interests don't align with yours?Yes, plus Google is a part of PRISM, surveillance program, used by NSA to spy on people.

8983	 Noctudeit	 And both pale in comparison to the threat posed by government agencies.They have more power to gather personal data and are generally behind the curve in data security tech.	
8984	 fGOws2TKaynyItHf	 &gt; Ahead of this Sunday's (January 28) Data Privacy Day, enterprise cyber security company Tripwire has conducted a poll of Twitter users asking who they were most concerned about collecting their private information.&gt; Of the more than 300 people who took part, 40 percent say they would be most worried about corporations stealing their information. While nearly a third (27 percent) say they are most concerned about the government gathering their critical data.&gt; However, only 21 percent gave identity theft by criminals as being their main concern. Just 12 percent were concerned about online stalkers and harassers storing their private information.&gt; The results suggest that organizations should be more transparent about their data collection practices, and that they need to demonstrate they have implemented appropriate safeguards against the threat of data leaks.&gt; Tripwire's experts offer a number of tips for looking after personal data. "Nearly the entire economy is geared to convince you that your data really doesn’t need to be private, and that you should freely share it," says Tim Erlin, VP of product management and strategy. "From social media, to loyalty programs, to smart home devices; all of these trends are built on the back of your data. Remember that it’s yours, and it’s valuable and you have a right to protect it and keep it private. That leads you to making explicit choices to share, rather than sharing by default. And maybe, that awareness changes a few of those choices."&gt; "Accept that your data is not private," advises Tyler Reguly, manager of security research and development. "Once you do that, you will find yourself less stressed when your data is inevitably breached. I have three rules that I try to live by:"&gt; * If they don't utilize Amazon/PayPal for payments, place your order elsewhere.&gt; * If you wouldn't get it developed at the store, don't take the picture.&gt; * Don't take risks with your primary PC. Restrict social media browsing to cell phones, tablets, and secondary PCs.&gt; Paul Norris, senior systems engineer for EMEA at Tripwire says, "As everyday interaction with the world around us is becoming more reliant on computer systems, it's even more vital that you should care and take action around your data privacy. These days, personal identifiable identification (PII) data can be stored at a lot of places ranging from local drives on laptops, through to portable media and cloud providers storing data online. It's imperative that you maintain individual strong passwords for all your online accounts, so if one account is compromised, other accounts do not suffer. And as you will have so many passwords to manage, consider using a password management piece of software and enable two-factor authentication to add a layer of security to your solution."	
8985	 Hationts1943	 I'm really rooting for Brave and I think it's going to be something fantastic when it hits mainstream users but I'm still on Firefox because I miss the configurability of uBlock and other extensions. I'll eventually jump ship, I think.	
8986	 rosmarines	 You where forced more or less at gunpoint to install the bloody thing, it was a safe bet Microsoft had ulterior motives and is not to be cheated out of their data mining payoff. Just keep your important business on another, safe machine.	
8987	 Hationts1943	 Those are entirely optional btw. That is a sandboxed version of Flash ("pepper flash") but you can turn that and the PDF viewer off in content settings.But for example, one of the many things other than the phoning home to the Google ship that I don't like is that WebRTC leaks your IP and you don't have an option to turn it off IIRC.	
8988	 Eidbi	 True, but majority of people (me included) never disable it. And even find it useful.Yes, this is horrible. As far as I am aware, you can block WebRTC by using uBlock Origin in Chrome, just like in Firefox. I have no idea how gorhill was able to do that, though.	
8989	 mariusfb	 I mean disabling all the logging and monitoring, using only the firewall parts.I think I had to activate Incognito Mode or something to disable all the graphs too.	
8990	 Hationts1943	 Wow, never noticed that option before. Thanks, man.	
8991	 userkp5743608	 You are grossly over-simplifying and generalizing with such a statement. Your perspective ignores at least two fundamental aspects of a business - their business model and their stakeholders. Currently, Proton Technologies is a private company whose business model is based on selling to a specific group of individuals interested in greater privacy than in available from providers like Google and Microsoft. A company turns a key corner when they become public, as they've clearly indicated an intent to put shareholder interests above any and all other competing interests. The world economic system cannot function with an organizational structure provided by "companies" (a broad and vague use of the word), so your statement belies a fundamental ignorance of basic economic knowledge.Oh, and I recognize your username. Yea, you still don't get it.

8996	 skidmark-steve	 Don't let it connect to the Internet, ever. You do not need to use Windows 10 to play video games, because you do not *need* to play video games. Most games will run on some other platform, be that Windows 7, Linux, or a game console. Take advantage of this fact. And for any that will only run on Windows 10 and nothing else (something that's unlikely in the current market), avoid them.Thing is, Windows 10 is likely to come with built in networking drivers for most hardware. This makes (really) disconnecting it in a dual-boot environment more difficult. (if Microsoft was willing to lie to customers before about things like support life-cycles, I wouldn't put it past them to lie about actually disabling network interfaces and not still using them for telemetry anyway).What I do, is run Windows 8.1 in a KVM pass-through setup. It never gets an Internet connection, physically prevented by the host, and it still runs games I want to play.For those questioning how Microsoft lied to customers, they explicitly said that Windows 8.1 would be in mainstream support until this year, but last year they blocked users of Windows 8.1 from updates if they switched to a modern processor when the Ryzen/Kaby Lake chips came out. That's not "mainstream support" by any stretch of the imagination, therefor they lied.

8999	 AlcoholicAsianJesus	 I've heard of [Bruce Schneier's](https://www.schneier.com/academic/solitaire/) [Solitaire Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solitaire_\(cipher\)), but there's been some [debate](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1653/what-is-the-most-secure-hand-cipher) as to whether or not it's as secure as it's been made out to be.As far as I know, the only unbreakable cipher is [One-time Pad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_pad). According to the wikipedia article on One-time Pad:&gt;If the key is truly random, is at least as long as the plaintext, is never reused in whole or in part, and is kept completely secret, then the resulting ciphertext will be impossible to decrypt or break.

You need to embrace Tor and not shy away from it. It's the only reliable tool to avoid passive (and active) monitoring of your connection. Maybe you just want to opt out of global dragnets, and that's within your right.

9010	 skidmark-steve	 I'll agree with this. Criminals are pretty darn easy to avoid. They don't have government granted monopolies and they don't permeate my every day existence.On the flip-side, in most cases today, I can't have a fully functional product without an online service being forced on me whether I want it or not.

9015	 skidmark-steve	 I tried to make Windows 7 work, but I couldn't find any Virtio drivers that the Windows installer would accept. (IDE is slower.) I would indeed rather be using 7, but since the network in the guest runs on a private TAP interface that only connects to the host (used for swapping the keyboard/mouse between host and guest) it isn't that big of a deal. I did of course install Classic Shell.Some people like to use Synergy on both sides to pass the keyboard/mouse between the two, but I came up with a more efficient way using scripts that tell Qemu what to do. Only the detach/attach commands are sent through the TAP, not every keystroke as would be done with Synergy. And less memory is used as well.

9036	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Tyranny, oppression and corruption are weeds that grow in darkness and in the soil of compromise; soil rigidly idealistic with abundant sunlight is the most hostile place for these weeds to grow.If we do not advocate for free software- for software that inherently offers transparency and accountability- we are doomed to be oppressed by closed source proprietary software that serves its creators rather than its users. If we do not advocate for resisting surveillance with every ounce of our capacity, we are doomed to watch it slowly take hold via our compromise. If we don't advocate for a system that affords each citizen the power to have control over his own life, we will see power centralize further creating a system where governments and corporations ultimately control what Liberties we have in life.Idealism- specifically on behalf of civil liberties- is the only means of securing a future we all have a say in; otherwise we will end up like every other totalitarian or oligarchical shithole of history.

9044	 Noctudeit	 I would argue that the government is worse because citizens have no way to prevent them from collecting data. For example, you can't choose not to file a tax return and even if you did you cannot stop other entities from filing tax documents on your behalf (W-2s, 1099s, 1098s, etc.)With private companies you at least have the option of not doing business with them. If you don't interact with them they cannot collect your data.

9046	 79cca0e8-d8ff-4ca9-9	 The landlord (and people who intercept packets) can see which sites you’re visiting and the volume of data that’s moving, but not the actual pages/data with HTTPS. The best approach would be to set up a VPN in your router and run everything through the VPN.	
9047	 OCROttawa	 Started writing this 5 times, have 20 questions but am not really interested in asking them because you can get this answer from a quick internet search.If you are using HTTPS your landlord (or anyone watching your internet connection) can’t see the data you are transmitting but they can see which web sites you are visiting.If you think your landlord is watching your internet traffic, and you are worried, then use Tor.

9067	 bradmont	 Maybe if you had the choice between sharing your data with just one or just the other. But that's my point -- the data these companies have goes straight to the government too. So it's not a question of whether a business is better or worse than the government. It's the difference between your data going to one potentially nefarious entity, or two.It's a completely unrelated point, but it's also incredibly hard to just "not do business" with companies like Google or Facebook. They collect massive amounts of data even on people who don't use their services. Yes, you can block third-party web sources and install browser plugins to limit tracking, but I'm sure they have tricks that the anti-tracker makers don't know about yet -- and some they do, like simple IP tracking, and let's be honest, how many people are really using tor or anonymising VPNs? Not to mention that they're tracking you more and more in the real world as well, through incredibly accurate facial recognition systems and the constant torrent of photos, videos and audio flowing into their data centres from every bozo with a cell phone...

9072	 RationalistRaven	 Probably [Facebook Analytics](https://analytics.facebook.com/) if they're trying to track your mobile presence, if we assume the worst-case scenario. I don't think the last I checked that they offer Facebook sign-in so that rules out that option, but they can still associate your device's ID and IP.Best case scenario, they might use media assets directly from Facebook (maybe?), but again like /u/Itsmafy said it's nothing but speculation since we don't know what's going on behind the scenes.I'd personally recommend switching to Bitwarden since it's FOSS, and offers a 2-step transfer process from your LastPass vault. 2FA, secure notes and browser extensions (the things you expect from LastPass) are all already there. :)	
9073	 Disclandr	 Short Summary:  The case became so famous that the thief decided to refund the bitcoins (fear of getting caught and arrested) but the victim had since reset the wallet seeds so now he is unable to access the funds and is now begging the thief to PM him the original seed (which I doubt the thief even still knows).  This victim must really have some bad Karma because even after the thief decided to give the money back there still came to pass a series of events that the victim still is unable to obtain the funds.  I have always wondered what happens to all the millions of bitcoins that are unable to be accessed because the owner has lost his seed.  Lesson for us to learn is to always write down our wallet seed on a piece of paper, and also take a picture of it with our phone and also have it backed up on a text file.  Do all 3 things for redundancy.  And scotch tape the piece of paper underneath one of the dining room chairs (or on the top of a ceiling fan blade) or scotch tape it to the back of a toilet tank

Tell us, instead, the reasons why you share these principles and what kind of person you are.And they're quite upfront about the fact that you really are supposed to donate.Far too much hassle for my taste. Set against that, Posteo is cheaper at 12 euros p.a if you want pop/k-9, privacy, anonymity and as much encryption as you want.

9082	 gurpreet-	 Privacy should be respected everywhere. By the government, by businesses and by people. It's a universal right.Not trying to bash the poll, but 300 people is hardly enough people to gain meaningful insight into what people perceive to be a threat to privacy, especially as the poll was conducted by an enterprise cyber security company. Furthermore, as the poll was conducted through its Twitter account, one would naturally assume more security conscious people will undoubtedly follow and respond to the poll.So contrary to the article, I believe that public perception to privacy is changing. Especially among the youth. The cited paper [1] shows that "younger people &amp; ethnic minorities are most concerned about lack of transparency &amp; consent", "bulk data collection constitutes surveillance" and that "[the] EU public think all surveillance technologies compromise human rights and are susceptible to abuse by security agencies".So, all is not lost, the rest of the public just needs convincing through education and easier-to-use privacy tools like VPNs, anonymous networks and cryptocurrencies that are more privacy oriented.* 1: [Public Feeling on Privacy, Security and Surveillance in late 2015, page 7 - 9](https://sites.cardiff.ac.uk/dcssproject/files/2015/11/Public-Feeling-on-Privacy-Security-Surveillance-DATAPSST-DCSS-Nov2015.pdf).

9088	 RationalistRaven	 Enpass are still worse IMO. I thought they looked good at first glance since they offered the ability to sync to your own cloud storage, but the fact that they're based in Gurgaon, India and that they're closed-source, plus the fact that you need to buy their mobile apps are so many strikes against them. They don't have many business clients so their reputation isn't on-the-line either. I'd still recommend LastPass over Enpass.	
9089	 theantnest	 Been using them for 6 months.Realised the lifetime subscription price was the same as Dropbox yearly price.Very good service but I have two gripes about the application:There is a weird explorer refresh glitch everytime a new file is synced.The audio player doesn't play FLAC files.Second one is no biggie, but the first one is super annoying. Have made support tickets about it, there have been a couple of application updates but still no fix.

9097	 mizzlenet	 Based on this guys post history he was using it for things like credit card fraud. Which if he got caught makes me think he’s not particularly bright. Also I’m going to guess that when he says “pornhub” he actually means kiddie porn.....	
9098	 sprudelel	 Well, cybercriminals don't require you to "read" a document designed to be unreadable as possible and accept it. 	
9099	 doofy666	 Which is almost exactly what they tell you not to do...I inferred from their sign up process that they wanted me to be a Chinese dissident in some obscure village needing comms with the central cell in some town or other.Still - you didn't share your other 19 lines; maybe you tried the Chinese dissident approach  :-)	
9100	 Disclandr	 I would be interested to hear you expound upon your statement.  Enpass is closed-source but same with Lastpass.  The company is based in India but how is that a negative thing?  Yes the mobile app costs $10 (one time fee) but thats still way cheaper than LastPass at $24 per year.  Also how do you know that they dont have many business clients?  The one thing I will agree with you about is the following negative points about Enpass:1)  They have never had a proper 3rd party security audit2)  The program forces you to enter your master password after every reboot (But same thing as KeePass)3)  Tech support is not very helpful and answers "We will be fixing that issue in the next release)I have been using Enpass for the last month.  That is why I definately respect you and want to hear your points if you feel that it is not a trustworthy software.     	
9101	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
9102	 Disclandr	 I have mine synced to dropbox and I have 2FA enabled on dropbox so that is at least 2 layers of protection, actually 3 layers.  A criminal would have to hack into dropbox and would have to know my email and password of dropbox, then they would have to defeat the 2FA on dropbox and after that they would need to crack my master password on the encrypted Enpass database file.  Enpass is not anywhere near as popular as LastPass so I doubt that sophisticated hackers are spending very much time looking for exploits in Enpass as compared to the competition.  	
9103	 Booteille	 Well. I *explained* why I wanted their service. So I went more in depths about what was my thoughts.Really, there wasn't a hard exercice.But to be honest, now I discover Tutanota, I am thinking about migrating to this one since the interface is more up to date with modern web technologies.

9107	 ItsInTheOtherHand	 Of course, unless you believe that your memory will be accurate and reliable for the duration, a one time pad has its own issues, because if you don't want to forget that, then you have to keep it. Of course you could encrypt *that*, but then we get a regress ad infinitum.The truth is, handwriting really can't compete with digital encryption, even on something like a small flash drive. Both can be lost/stolen, but one is much more secure.	
9108	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
9109	 RationalistRaven	 Hi there /u/Disclandr, I appreciate you reaching out and not immediately assuming the worst. Dialogue is important and I respect that you're looking for mine :DTo answer your question: firstly, you mentioned that the mobile app costs $10, and compared that to LastPass' $24/year. And when syncing was locked to their pro plan, that was certainly true and was something that turned me against them, however now that it's a free feature it's not a downside.The reason that it's bad that they're based in India is that they're not subject to the same strict consumer privacy protection laws that the EU and States are obliged to follow. Say what you will about mass-surveillance, but for protection from unsavoury use of your data to other companies, and for the need to follow advertising standards to avoid an FCC complaint (meaning no false statements about the privacy of your application), the States and EU still are far, far better in this respect. It's much more difficult to make false statements and that's clear by things like [FyreFestival](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/arts/music/billy-mcfarland-fyre-festival-arrested.html) and the [TMartn](https://www.pcgamesn.com/counter-strike-global-offensive/csgo-tmartn-csgolotto-lawsuit-2017) scandals.The lack of open-source wouldn't be a big deal if they had a third-party audit, but as you acknowledged, they haven't to-date.As for my evidence that they don't have many business clients, this is simply an inference I will admit, but they do not offer any business-oriented plan, do not offer any businesses that are using their software nor case studies, and lack the features businesses need such as LDAP and SSO functionality. For small businesses, they may still use it as it's cheaper, but the missing business options would mean that for large enterprises, they would not use it. Enterprises are the ones who can truly influence a company's reputation and so without the need for credibility from them, they can get away with more.	
9110	 Disclandr	 ChromeOS is the least private OS you could ever choose, even worst than Winshit 10I have a chromebook and even with VPN turned on when I went into my browsing history (on a different computer) every single page I had visited on the Chromebook was listed.  There is not a single damn thing you can do on the Chromebook that wont have Goolag looking over your shoulder on it.  The whole reason Chromebooks are so cheap is because they have been subsidized by Goolag because this way Goolag can spy so easily on everything you do.  I am not even convinced that when you switch to Crouton that they cant still spy on everything you do inside Crouton as well.  Please, never mention ChromeOS on this sub  	
9111	 RationalistRaven	 Everyone, including ProtonMail use some form of trackers. Their actual [vault](https://github.com/bitwarden/browser) and [web-panel](https://github.com/bitwarden/web) are fully open source and can even be run on-premises if you prefer. I'm sure that the GA code is merely so that they can understand things like which languages need localization, and if you'd like to opt-out specifically on their website there's things like uBlock Origin to do so.	
9112	 JDGumby	 No, we need limits on those privacy-destroying abominations as well.	
9113	 Disclandr	 Check out Standard Notes as a good alternative to Evernote. Ever-scrote    (a pun on the name with scrotum) 	
9114	 garlic_rocker	 Your first statement is false, but also explains why I _do not_ recommend ProtonMail over other providers which don't track you (e.g. Posteo).I shouldn't have to use uBlock Origin to not load *third-party content* on a password manager.

If the top 50 companies in the world were all making the same amount per user, and if all of them paid out 90% of that money to the affected users, that would amount to $195 per month. That wouldn't be a bad paycheck, but it's still a ways off from UBI levels.	
9117	 Disclandr	 Thank you for those links and I will be looking into it right away.  Speaking of LastPass I can tell you that they **DOUBLED** their subscription price a few months ago from $12 to $24 and based on that trend I can "infer" myself that there is a good chance that the 2fa with TOTP apps that is currently being offered with free accounts will mostly likely be going "the way of the DoDo bird" very soon.   What I am saying is that they will most likely strip away the free 2fa feature on free accounts and only include it in the premium version.  I guess we are both "making predictions" based off of what we see.  	
9118	 TheWafflian	 Way I see it, these products simply need to be open about what data is collected. I don't actually have issue with "being the product" if I'm getting some thing in return, like the connectivity that FB offers. The government spying, though, there's no choice to that. No deciding if you're willing to pay the privacy price for the product. 	
9119	 [deleted]	 How good is this compared to Mega.nz?	
9120	 altGear	 Haven't tried mega NZ but pCloud with it's swiss based servers is geared towards privacy and security. Also:a) Integrated Mac pDrive folder within Mac finder windowb) Fully Encrypted folder availablec) Public folder w/ link to share files &amp; create links to share files and foldersSummary: mac integration of pDrive (and sync) is beautiful, having a public folder and being able to share files with a simple link is great &amp; having an encrypted file to store private info makes this an amazing product! Look up swiss privacy laws...they are some of the best in the world.

9122	 RationalistRaven	 It's not _literally_ true, I admit. I understand why you wouldn't like sites that use tracking, but given the extent of it, and given that it's pretty easy to opt-out, I see it not as a deal-breaker.	
9123	 RationalistRaven	 Of course, and as I said elsewhere in the thread LastPass is certainly not good, but for the general public's threat model it's not _bad_ either. It has an enterprise foundation which makes it at least financially viable without sacrificing too much user privacy (as encryption is user-held which is good). I'd still recommend Bitwarden because it's fully open source and self-hostable, two very commendable traits for private services.

9125	 da063f7e3b579ad0b434	 This would make the privacy situation even worse because then you're not only not doing something, you're declining payment which makes you look even more suspicious.	
9126	 share_me_plz	 Yes, I never use Google Play. If you use LineageOS it will never ask.	
9127	 garlic_rocker	 I believe all US mail is scanned, though not frequently opened. A padded manilla envelope would be a good bet, with a dark wrapping inside if you want to be extra safe.	
9128	 practicalguy	 Yep Maidsafe been saying this for years. 	
9129	 R41z	 That's... just bad.	
9130	 notroot404	 Well to some stuff. They really are bitching about how much encryption is limiting their access to information though. Remember the whole fight between Apple and the FBI?

9136	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 I would suggest using an offline password manager. I don't remember the name. But it's discussed rather frequently on this sub. I don't use password managers. I print my passwords and hide them in my house.	
9137	 catFishbatFish	 It's legal but I remember hearing that it can be used as some sort of probable cause? Not sure, but if you're not doing anything illegal then don't worry. If you are then be smart.

9139	 SenorDevil	 Thanks. Which do you recommend?	
9140	 JustaReverseFridge	 and every single benifit this app brings is nullified by the fact that your using apple, a prism cooperater, and a closed source operating system but if all means if you want slightly more private signal then by all means sign away your privacy

9143	 my-fav-show-canceled	 &gt; And both pale in comparison toThe trouble is that all are bad enough that it really doesn't matter which one is worse.  You still have to do battle with them all. Sensationalizing the worst mostly just helps to write article headlines.The question of what's worse is practically always academic.  The substantive question is what can we do about it.  This question is enemy number one to all aggressors.The evil hacker: You're too stupid; it's pointless to try.Zuckerberg: Privacy is dead.FBI Director James Comey: There is no such thing as absolute privacy in America...These are all meant to shutdown the question.  If we let the shutdown happen we're like the smoker who says "we're all going to die someday" as if sooner is the same as later.Sometimes I feel like the "which is worse" question is a shutdown.  We can't just obsess about the one thing or how hard the problem is.We can't stop one hundred percent of car fatalities but we still have seatbelts and airbags.  We've improved suspension and tires for greater control. We flip people off when they text and drive (low efficacy but feels good). We have chassis that absorb catastrophic impacts by crumpling. On and so on.  Things get better when we shoot for the impossible.So, yeah, that's enough rambling from me.  Uh! Get motivated.	
9144	 AlcoholicAsianJesus	 It might be better then, to choose something innocuous as a key, like a book or something. Something you wouldn't mind keeping around that could be hidden in plain sight. If you're not a reader and think people might be suspicious if you start carrying around a book all the time, a small notebook of contacts would work as long as it had enough names and numbers in it.That will work if you only need to encrypt a small bit of personal information for yourself. However, if you're communicating with someone with encrypted messages, you'll both need to agree on a key beforehand; Something publicly available that you can both access without raising any suspicions, like the landing page of a blog or a newspaper. You'll want to make sure that you choose a source that will update often enough to provide you with a new key for each new message you wish to encrypt since using the same key twice may cause your messages to be vulnerable to certain cryptographic attacks.	
9145	 zenithar89	 OpenVPN for Android	
9146	 hivecircuit	 i have a Copperhead OS phone so i dont have access to anything but Fdroid on it, not without giving root access to the outside	
9147	 AlpacaKid	 Great information thanks.Should I never login to forum accounts on a Windows and iOS system? So are email accounts, even privacy friendly ones, should be considered compromised if I logged into them on a Windows or iOS machine? Any reason for Tutanota in particular? I've been using Chromium on my CopperheadOS phone, as it was what came as default. I thought it was safe because of such. Recently, I've been using Brave on it instead, is that also bad? When you say Tor is the only choice for privacy, are you saying to use the Tor browser is the only privacy option? What about things like Firefox with the Tor addon?Is it difficult to do that with a router? I've never looked into that before.I checked and some of the forums don't even show me a privacy policy, maybe I'll have to email them for it.	
9148	 AsteroidsOnSteroids	 It's definitely a crypto seed. If OP wouldn't put a big wad of cash in a regular envelope and send it snail mail, then OP shouldn't do that with this either. 	
9149	 catFishbatFish	 With root can't you route everything through Tor with the app? Even without root I think you can do it using Android built in VPN capabilities. Also RIP copperhead as it is no longer free software.	
9150	 AsteroidsOnSteroids	 Sounds like your metal plate has some sensitive and/or valuable information on it. Your best bet is to go to a mail carrier service and ask what their options are for tamper proof/tamper evident shipping. Also, insure it, and require a signature at delivery. If you can specify a specific person that has to receive it, even better. If anything goes wrong, insurance will cover it. If the carrier says they delivered it without issue, the signature will help figure out who really took it. A tamper proof container is probably over kill, but a tamper evident one definitely isn't. A tamper evident package can be as simple as a regular envelope or box sealed shut with a kind of tape that tears itself apart when peeled off. That way if someone tries to carefully peel the tape away, take the contents, and then put the tape back, it will be evident that someone tampered with it. The envelope is also sort of inherently tamper evident since any tears or cuts won't go away. Just make sure any folds or seams that could be easily cut and glued back are covered with that tape. You don't even need to ask the carrier about this since you can just buy the tape yourself and use it. As for X-ray, I know that domestic US mail isn't xrayed, but international mail is. I'm not sure how it works in the EU but that shouldn't be too hard to look up. If it turns out that it will be xrayed, sandwiching it between two bricks of lead will be more than enough to block the X-rays. In fact two pieces of centimeter-thick steel plates should be more than enough too. Go to a scrapyard, machine shop, or anywhere you can think of where you can get or cut two plates of steel that are of similar shape and area to your plate. Place your crypto seed between those other two plates and tape them together with a layer of that tamper evident tape. Stick that in an envelope and you should be good. And don't forget the insurance!

9154	 i010011010	 We need to get something straight: analytics _is_ spyware.  Just because it's being done to us by a company slightly more reputable than Gator doesn't mean it isn't the same damn thing.Further, there is no such thing as 'aggregate' information.  That's another lie that's been perpetuated in order to excuse data practices that are as condemnable as the scummiest spyware company.  There's no such thing as an internet packet that didn't have an IP address, and most of these systems further fingerprint you in some way.  You take any such database, sell it to Facebook and they can easily correlate it with the massive data they already possess.  **All** data on the internet is--at most--one or two steps removed from being associated with you in an identifiable manner.People need to start holding developers accountable for their data connectivity, and get past this notion that if we're using software then they can take what they want and do whatever they are wont.

9157	 No-User-Name	 No but the benefits of HookTube is also non use of other Google tracking domains, take a look at it with uBlock Origin and compare. it's a more privacy way to view video content in my opinion in a lot of scenarios. for instant Safari users who prefer content blockers only... or using the Tor browser with VPN and full Tor network users benefit most by keeping the browser fingerprint resistance while viewing video content without Google/ad tracking domains. if you're skeptical that's fine by all means don't use it.

9165	 unique616	 The best way that I know of to have privacy at your doctor's is to go to a DPC provider. https://www.dpcfrontier.com/mapper For the practice to qualify as a direct primary care practice the practice must:1) charge a periodic fee 2) not bill any third parties on a fee for service basis, and3) any per visit charge must be less than the monthly equivalent of the periodic feeIn my case, I pay $360 every January for an unlimited amount of doctors visits per year, and the medicine that she prescribes is medicine that she has purchased in wholesale quantities and has on site so she just gives it to you. There are no pharmacies involved. Nothing gets shared with any health insurance companies.

Vivaldi will send a message using HTTPS directly to our servers located in Iceland every 24 hours containing this ID, version, cpu architecture, screen resolution and time since last message. We anonymize the IP address of Vivaldi users by removing the last octet of the IP address from your Vivaldi client then we store the resolved approximate location after using a local geoip lookup. The purpose of this collection is to determine the total number of active users and their geographical distribution.we just lazy to read every TOS/Privacy Policy every Apps/Website/etc and just click Install/Allow/Ok/etc	
9169	 akunbaru	 nope, you can't totally move out from Google ecosystem without root access, and you just had root access, there is so much work to do the things work done,it's a good move to avoid installing app from Play Store and never login you google account into the phone	
9170	 Zodiac____	 Nope, nothing like that. All cores where evenly loaded at 10%-20%.I have decided to switch to DiskCryptor for the time being. i get a performance hit of 20% with that, which is far more acceptable.

9174	 FeatheryAsshole	 Even disregarding whether this is actually an incident of spying, did anyone think that Vivaldi is particularly strict about privacy ... ?

9182	 Youknowimtheman	 Interesting. Is it using the same settings? I see that it is using AES-XTS but it is not clear what the keysize is. I know that VeraCrypt is using 256-bit.	
9183	 NiPinga	 Agreed, in fact it is dumb and possibly dangerous to think that the data of your phones, tablets pc's and such are not combined. It takes companies like pega or salesforce about 2 days to link all your devices to your profile, after you have deleted all cookies, local storage and so on. If you believe that on one device you are somehow "more private" or separated from the rest, you better think again... And while googles and FB may be the worst of their kind, why would you want to think your bank is not into this? Or your favorite online shop... or reddit ...	
9184	 gnujedi	 CoppeheadOS is not proprietary. Some of the code base is under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license](https://github.com/CopperheadOS/platform_build/blob/oreo-mr1-release/COPPERHEAD_LICENSE). Other parts are under the GPL. They had issues with people using builds and not honoring the CC license, thus they stopped offering completed builds on their server. You can still build it from source yourself, and the code is all accessible on Github. I'm tired of people giving them a hard time. They only have a small team, and it's what they do for a living. Some of their code gets upstreamed to Android and they still care about keeping their code transparent and usuable.As for using Tor with CopperheadOS, you can use Orbot in VPN mode and it will route traffic through Tor. You can select which apps you want to route without needing root access. Mike Perry was [working on a prototype](https://blog.torproject.org/mission-improbable-hardening-android-security-and-privacy) device that routed everything through Tor on a CopperheadOS Nexus 6P in 2016. 	
9185	 aproposnix	 LOL&gt;Vivaldi is not "spyware." Piwik is not a "spyware company" (unless Google, Facebook, Yahoo, TVGuide, Microsoft, Apple, NYT, Huffpo, Ancestry.com, WaPo, CenturyLink and McAfee are "spyware companies" All of them *are* spyware companies!	
9186	 AsteroidsOnSteroids	 That's where the tamper evident tape comes in. It'll turn anything tamper evident as long as you use it smartly. Now it won't stop someone from opening and stealing the crypto before you realize it's been opened. You could send it in a locked box, and send the key separately, but they could possibly still open the box for inspection along the way. Maybe your mail carrier has a system where you can elect for an inspection before it's shipped to ensure it won't be flagged along the way. In the US you can actually fly commercially with guns. They need to be in your checked luggage, and they will hand inspect your bag with you present before you lock it and keep the key, ensuring the TSA couldn't get in even if they wanted to. So maybe there is something similar for mail.Another option is to consider hiding in plain sight. Don't send 1 plate. Send a bunch of scrap metal with your plate thrown in. Or make it more believable and buy maybe a toy construction set, or some piece of furniture or a tool that requires assembly out of the box. Throw your plate in there and one little piece of metal won't look out of place, and no one's going to go digging through a tv mounting bracket kit looking for cryptokeys.	
9187	 HawkEy3	 That made me laugh too. 	
9188	 SimonWoodburyForget	 That's because your data is used to make the product functional. Just take SwiftKey, it would never work without sufficient data on your vocabulary. Even anonymized Reddit would look more like 4chan then anything. To be completely private it would have to forget the time,  date,  username... of posts and comments. On top of that it would have to ambiguate the text, to prevent data hoarders from drawing relations between messages. Without keeping IP address information and generally all user behaviour, it would be impossible to stop service abuses, like DDoS. Impossible to makespam good spam filters without your email data. A service without data has no chance of being functional. (this text is data) I would not watch YouTube if it didn't recommend me content I want to watch. I would not read reddit if it wasn't sortable by new or hot or was filled with spam. Drawing dark conclusions from everything that is data archiving just because it can be used to indentify you and assuming it could be done without is insane. 	
9189	 maxline388	 Why should I be part of the government in order to get your info? You're so willing to hand over your information to strangers that work for the government, yet you don't want to hand it to people that don't work for the government?Do you really trust the government that much?	
9190	 mirh	 &gt; (in fact, management engine is an ARM chip with trustzone)No, that's AMD's PSP implementation if any (and having a secondary cpu performs these functions, rather than the "usual one" is quite different in turn)Management engine is an intel quark x86 cpu, running minix. 	
9191	 LizMcIntyre	 StartPage.com offers a free proxy link with every search result so you can visit websites anonymously, too, u/dontsyncjustride. This prevents 3rd party websites and their advertisers from tracking users. Also stops them from adding spyware and malware to user computers since StartPage is acting as the proxy.	
9192	 Zodiac____	 I used the same settings as in Veracrypt. I really have no idea what the actual difference is. I found some posts on the Veracrypt forums that merely say it has to do with "internal organization of I/O" but that's it. I'm somewhat worried that DiskCryptor is just a sham and is just pretending to be proper encryption but I think I'll go with it for now :/

9197	 thibaultmartin	 I don't get why this got downvoted. The essence of the message is not "all OS are equal regarding privacy", it is "while some OS are more privacy enabled than others, you can still compromise your privacy easily with a web browser".The recommendations are also very correct, as most of the tracking is performed through javascript. uMatrix does a great job at preventing that. There are a lot of additionnal information to give (e.g. how to prevent browser fingerprinting) but not in a single Reddit comment :)

9214	 Booteille	 Linux Mint is a very good distribution for anyone discovering the Linux World.I just heard about Solus today. Maybe you can give it a shot: https://solus-project.com/Don't hesitate to use a virtual machine like VMWare or VirtualBox to try distributions a couple of days before installing it on your hard drive.Concerning DNS, maybe Quad 9 could be a good choice. I didn't tried it yet, though.	
9215	 Youknowimtheman	 Well they both use AES-XTS when you select AES, but it's not clear what the keysize is for DiskCryptor from the documentation that I looked at. A smaller keysize would explain the performance difference.	
9216	 Skipper_Blue	 It's shitty that Vivaldi would run piwik on its application, but piwik is not Spyware by a long stretch. It's just a free web analytics platform to track visitors. 	
9217	 Kendos-Kenlen	 It's much better as Firefox use Google Analytics to get datas... Edit At least on add-on pages, I don't know about the rest of Firefox.	
9218	 Kendos-Kenlen	 There are Edge and Safari also, which have their own engines.They are the 4 real browsers, even if they are not equals in market share (they can feel free to steal Chrome' users).	
9219	 ooax	 This. I think it's the tracking done by a browser vendor that led to the outrage, not the company providing a tracking utility. (...and piwik is one of the better, more open tracking utilities.)If you'd hypothetically track yourself nobody would say that's spyware. But if you use the (soft)ware to spy, you just made it your spyware.	
9220	 3WZTDW3	 Now, I don't use Vivaldi, nor Piwik, but IF they "needed" to have analytics, then isn't it theoretically better for the user's privacy that they use Piwik, which to my knowledge is analytics that Vivaldi themselves host, instead of going the Google Analytics route wich 99% of apps use?I'm not defending Vivaldi/analytics, just saying that it could have been worse, they could have used GA.	
9221	 FeatheryAsshole	 By far the best solution would be to make your own. Afaik it's not really more expensive, though it might use a bit more power. Of course, you'll have to know some basics about linux/bsd system admin (e.g. how to install the OS and some commandline basics) and invest some time into building and configuring the device.	
9222	 gladykov	 Is there any Wiki or Subreddit for Facebook alternatives? I would like to find good social network or social media website with interesting articles and high quality discussion. Tried to find some comparison between mentioned above, but I find it not easy.	
9223	 seaninthecity	 I figured, but interested to see what people start saying. What are you running if anything? Thoughts on Nextcloud versus anyone else for both privacy and security - emphasis on privacy  Thank you!	
9224	 fongaboo	 Yeah I'd build a FreeNAS if you want to be sure that the thing isn't phoning home to it's corporate creators in some way. FreeNAS is open source.	
9225	 FeatheryAsshole	 My fileserver runs Debian stable. I don't think Nextcloud phones home, but I'm not really an expert on that. It's possibly also less secure than a regular old samba share?	
9226	 PracticalPrivacy	 Probably true. It is interesting though that both of these companies have essentially one product (ads). Maybe slightly less so for Google, but I think non-ad revenue still only makes up something like 10-15% of their total. If that model was disrupted or disappeared, these companies would be in a lot of mid-term financial trouble.	
9227	 AngeLusFr	 https://redd.it/7jvm2tThis and the fact that Waterfox is a fork that change this : https://i.imgur.com/49eTLTh.pngit mean that Firefox has data collection and telemetrySo after 2 things that don't respect privacy for a compagny that say that privacy matter, it's just a good bye for me

9231	 Cherry_Cher	 Is there any way to disable this? I use Vivaldi and I quite like it. I'd hate to(and honestly probably won't) switch browsers over some analytics garbage.	
9232	 postlapsar	 This is the same old excuse. “I want more privacy, BUT... I can't [play my favorite game, run my favorite social media app, insert excuse]” or complain that Linux is too hard or that you have to pay $10 for private email when Yahoo is free. It goes on and on. If you want privacy, you must change some things and you SHOULD pay or donate because most privacy tools are run by small teams with few resources. End rant.	
9233	 Cherry_Cher	 How does anyone think that Facebook ISN'T a spyware company?	
9234	 bloodvayne	 The way the OP made his thread made him look like an entitled ass.	
9235	 NAN001	 Piwik is a platform that allows developers to install their own analytic tools on their website instead of using a third-party tool like Google Analytics. The point being, you don't leak your users' behavior's data to another company; if everybody was using Piwik, there would be no third-party commonly used by multiple sites that is able to trace the history and behavior of every user on every site using the tool (which is the position of Google Analytics on virtually the entire web).That being said, just like Google Analytics, Piwik is based on a great deal of client-side behavior analysis (mouse movements, clicks, etc), which can be discussed as being spyware. The most conservative definition of spyware would definitely classify client-side analytic logic as such. It's code running on the user's machine and phoning data home, a.k.a. spyware.In this specific case, I'm unsure of what the connections spotted by OP in the Vivaldi forum is about. The worst-case would be that the browser leverages Piwik's features on the entire user behavior in the browser. In this setting (closed-source product that is very complex to build yet somehow free), I usually don't put much trust in the brand.	
9236	 JDGumby	 &gt; it's not "spyware", its "piwik" **Analytic App**...and therefore spyware.	
9237	 Geminii27	 I like the comment in that thread which said:&gt;This data is kind of necessary in order to build software as you need to know who you're building it for.Guess what - it might be necessary (it's not - it's just convenient), but that doesn't make it OK to steal it. If it's something you need, you buy it or you request it politely.	
9238	 JDGumby	 &gt; It's just a free web analytics platform to track visitors. In other words, it's spyware.	
9239	 N03y3s	 This is what I would recommend:- Windows: I think you should use Window$ 10 even though it destroys your privacy because, first, support for Window$ 7 ends in 2020, then, Micro$oft doesn't hides the fact that they spy on you and, at last, a lot programs that run on Window$ will be compatible with Window$ 10 and their newer version will likely only be compatible with W10.- GNU/Linux: I would recommend Qubes OS which is very stable as of today. However, it only supports hardware that meets those requirements: https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/system-requirements/ (However a machine with intel core I5/I7 with vt-d and vt-x support and 8/16 Go RAM will do). If you have little knowledge with GNU/Linux you should start with an another user-friendly distribution such as Linux Mint. ( If you want to be secure in public places or if you need to be anonymous, there is Tails OS, a GNU/Linux distribution that is installed in a USB key and don't remember anything after being used, so, any malware that have infected it, is removed upon shutdown. You can, however, create an encrypted storage that only remember what you have selected. https://tails.boum.org/ )- Dual Boot: I wouldn't recommend dual booting Qubes OS because of security considerations ( https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/multiboot/ ). In that case I would suggest using two HDDs. One with Qubes OS and an another with whatever you want on it.- DNS: If you want a "perfect" DNS, I would suggest that you self-host it (with a Raspberry Pi for example) or use one from OpenNIC.- Encryption: When installing a GNU/Linux distribution, an option to encrypt the hard drive/partition is given. You have to enter a password that you will have to type in everytime you boot your computer (be aware that this password is and shall be different than your session password and/or root password). When you wipe your HDD or delete the partition in which your distribution is encrypted, it will remove the encryption on that HDD/partition.To encrypt Window$, there is an open source sotware known as Veracrypt (for the time being you can only encrypt Window$ if it isn't in dual boot).- Mozilla: It is clear that, indeed, Mozilla started to do strange decisions. For the time being I would suggest to continue using firefox because it has the latest security features and support addons. Thunderbird seems not to be affected by those decisions so you should be safe using it (it also support addons such as enigmail which uses GPG to encrypt messages). If you still want not to use Thunderbird, there is Claws Mail (but I've never used it).- Addons: Having too much addons can compromise your privacy. The ones I recommend however are:- privacy badger (tracker blocking)- https everywhere (force HTTPS when available)- Noscript (block java scripts [whitelist/blacklist theme at will])- cookie autodelete (delete cookies after you quit a website)- ublock (adblocker that seems trustwothy compared to adblock)- hooktube redirect: (redirect a youtube link to hooktube)- Youtube:On Window$: There is a project called peertube (still in early stages) and/or use hootktube redirect.On android: For your subscriptions you can use an android application called Skytube which is open source and can subscribe to any youtube channel without the need to have a google account. (Alternatively you can use Newpipe. Personnaly, I use Skytube for subscriptions and Newpipe to download videos and audios.)- Firewall: On Linux Mint, there already is an integrated firewall. On Window$, I would suggest you search for an open source firewall, else you can keep the one you found.- Antivirus: On GNU/Linux, you don't need any AV. On Window$, there is Clamwin, which is open source (I never used it so I can't say how accurate it is) or Immunet (Kaspersky is the one of the best solution to me).- Android: any custom rom will do because a custom rom is still more privacy enabled than a stock one. (Copperhead is the best available, though) You should use Fdroid which delivers only FOSS and FLOSS applications. (It is an app store). If you still want apps, like games, that come from Google play store, you can use an open source app (that can be found in Fdroid) called Yalp Store (You don't need any Google account because Yalp Store offers one).- Privacy tips:- Tor: It is one of the best solution if you want to be anonymous on the Internet so that companies cannot track you through sites you visit. There is Orbot and Orfox (which can be downloaded through Fdroid). For Window$, you can download it here ( https://torproject.org/ ). (Warning: do not use a VPN when using Tor as it is a privacy issue and don't log into your accounts on Tor because it will ruin your anonymity. Also, I strongly suggest you to not go to illegal website as it is not secure and bad things can happen. You will be safe if you go to clearnet websites however. Finally, do not add any addons to Tor Browser.)- FOSS and FLOSS: mainly use open source applications because you can be assured of what it does in contrary to closed source software. (If there is no alternative, then use the closed source software.)- Passwords: I would suggest using KeepassX as a password manager (which can also be used on android).Alternatively, you can create secure passwords with a method called diceware.If, there is still things you need to check, visit privacytoolsIO ( https://www.privacytools.io/ ).(Also, you should check Protonmail which is a privacy oriented email (like Tutanota which is what I use) based in Switzerland. If you want privacy enabled laptops/phones by design, I suggest you check purism's librem devices on this site ( https://puri.sm/ ). If you can't afford one and you are a little "tech savvy" you could purchase a lenovo x230 on which you can install coreboot ( an open source bootloader ) and heads ( a firmware checker ) along with Qubes OS. )	
9240	 Geminii27	 No. If they 'needed' analytics, they could politely request them or buy them off users. Just because something is useful for a business doesn't mean they have a right to take it by stealth.	
9241	 Geminii27	 I'm blocking the domains in hosts. If it still doesn't work I'll block them at the router.

9245	 AngeLusFr	 Wow thanks a lot for this listWindows : This is why I though I would just download an old ISO of Windows 7 that include every update before they include their telemetry in itI also plan to disable Windows Update completlyLinux : I think I will go for Mint I don't know a lot about Linux so QubesOS is maybe a bit too hard for meDual Boot : If I use Mint Dual Boot should be okDNS : I will take a look Encryption : Will it work if I have a DualBoot in another partition of the same disk ? (SSD)Mozilla : Waterfox seem to be almost the same but without spyware so it's maybe betterAddons : I have all of them except the first one :DYoutube : Peertube seem to not be youtube but a completly different website, I would like a website/software that can track each channel that I want, so that I don't have to use a Youtube account to subscribe to it Firewall : For a firewall on linux I would really like to have something that block everything exceptw what I want is it possible ?Antivirus : Some say that an AV is needed in LinuxAndroid : I know that it's maybe better than a stock one, but it still include some code of google, so except Copperhead there don't seem to exist any android rom that don't include anything from googleTor : Yeah I know TOR but I don't understand why a VPN is not good in TOR, it will be like another server so it will just be another protection ? No ?Password : I already use KeePassI already checked https://www.privacytools.io/ but it seem to lack some software/website, so it's always better to ask actual usersI already use Tutanota, Protonmail is only better because it's in Switzerland and not in Germany (like Tutanota) but the fact is that I think Tutanota is better for everything else	
9246	 kzshantonu	 It'd have to be targeted. And it requires physical access to enable recording even if phone is off. But then we don't know what 3LA is capable of	
9247	 FAZORNi	 can it be targeted only by knowing phone number? and what is 3LA?	
9248	 kzshantonu	 As much as we think we know, no, just a phone number isn't enough to record using microphone. 3LA = 3 letter agency	
9249	 JudgeJoeCool	 It's literally the second paragraph of the privacy policy	
9250	 uel1337	 Hey I can help you out HMU	
9251	 australian_user	 If you do have to subscribe, just connect to Australia via a VPN and subscribe it's AUD 3.99 per month (~USD 3.25). You also don't have to prove you're a student.https://i.imgur.com/LB9cHrJ.pngThen you can login directly from the US. I share my login with a few people.	
9252	 randomgamerguy1997	 What are the domains?	
9253	 australian_user	 They're not a registrar. They are the domain registrant.	
9254	 zenithar89	 For Linux, I suggest Fedora. It is not as hard as people think and it is stable and upstream at the same time. For Mozilla, there is GNU Icecat which is Mozilla Firefox which all the non-free, propriety parts removed. For LineageOS, you don't have to install Google apps. You can have a vanilla installation and use F-Droid for the apps you need. For e-mail, Protonmail is good, it doesn't support e-mail clients like Thunderbird though. For DNS, OpenNIC is good.	
9255	 Geminii27	 I'm just blocking vivaldi.com and update.vivaldi.com at the moment. Maybe more later as they come to light.	
9256	 Geminii27	 Putting it in a policy doesn't make theft and spying OK.	
9257	 SODYOUTHEN	 That they collect them is in both the EULA and the Privacy Policy. They do request them - you agreed to it. 	
9258	 JudgeJoeCool	 Yes but you said, quote, "request it politely," and they did. In clear, non-legalese, unambiguous language. 	
9259	 Geminii27	 That's not a request. That's a claim.	
9260	 xxVb	 Not all big data companies, however suspicious, deal in spyware.	
9261	 SODYOUTHEN	 How's it theft if they tell you about it, and exactly what they do with it? 	
9262	 Geminii27	 You assume I agreed to it. Could have been the cat walking on the keyboard and clicking it. Could have been a toddler. Could have been a book falling off the shelf. I could have modified the text of the policy to be blank in the installer before clicking 'OK'. Or bypassed that check with a patch.Not to mention that changing the policy *after* someone has installed the software is pretty dodgy.	
9263	 Geminii27	 "I'm gonna steal your wallet and use it to buy drugs. PS this applies retroactively even if you didn't agree to it before."	
9264	 SODYOUTHEN	 There's nothing retroactive, those have been the terms for ages. That's also a false comparison. It's more accurate to say "I'm going to take some info in exchange for this tool you're using. If you're not happy with that, please don't use it." 	
9265	 Exaskryz	 Hell, if analytics are supposed to improve their browser, instead of making guesses based on data, they could actually use their forum's wildly busy suggestions forum for ideas. But they take maybe 1 or 2 ideas out of hundreds -- often standard features of competitor browsers -- every 3 monħs in a new version release.After this submission, I'll be dropping Vivaldi it looks like. It's too featureless in the areas that matter, and have too expansive of features in areas that don't matter. And wiħ privacy concerns, no need for me to use it.	
9266	 SODYOUTHEN	 They didn't change the policy, it's been included for ages. If you don't like it, don't use the free software - buy one with the terms you want, or make your own. If you didn't agree to it, uninstall the software. End of problem. 	
9267	 Freefall01	 Perhaps encrypt it  and send the key a few months later or over another channel.	
9268	 J0bon	 Thanks for the tip. I don't think my professor is checking whether or not I actually subscribed, we just need to be able to access the articles for class. 	
9269	 Flynamic	 Ridiculous. That could be applied to any digital agreement you have made, including ticking a checkbox to allow analytics. Take some responsibility: if you download and use Vivaldi and care about your privacy, you should have read their policy.&gt;Not to mention that changing the policy after someone has installed the software is pretty dodgy.Was this confirmed though?	
9270	 SODYOUTHEN	 No. The OP is being a tool and already got called out for this on the Vivaldi forum. He's yet to bring anything up to back up that claim. 	
9271	 Flynamic	 Yep that's why I asked, OP in the forum claims they 'amended' it.	
9272	 SODYOUTHEN	 No, it's a request. "If you want to use this software, these are the terms. If you don't like them, please don't." No one is forcing you to use Vivaldi - you're free up a) use a different free browser b) make your own that does exactly what you want	
9273	 N03y3s	 I don't think Waterfox was updated to the latest firefox and therefore do not include patches for security vulnerabilites such as the Specter flaw.Dual boot is great as long as one of the two partitions (or more) isn't infected because they share the same bootloader.On GNU/Linux, the encryption only encrypt the linux partition, therefore, encryption will work. However, Window$ will not be encrypted even with Veracrypt because it doesn't support dual boot. On Window$, with dual boot, you can use bitlocker to encrypt the window$ partition but it requires a special configuation such as the bootloader being the Window$' one and you will also need a TPM on your board or a USB key whose sole purpose would be to store the encryption key.For youtube, I recommended you use Skytube along with Newpipe. I use Skytube to subscribe to channels (because of its User Interface and whose purpose is to track whenever a video is uploaded) and Newpipe to download video and audio directly from youtube. (In Skytube's last update, video downloading was added.) Both are android applications which are open source.Frankly, I do not use any antivrus on GNU/Linux because software repositories are checked using gpg keys and because it receives updates daily/weekly if you use a rolling-release for example. A firewall is already integrated to Linux Mint and it is possible to block the entire traffic and whitelist what you want.If you use a VPN with Tor, the said VPN will receive your original IP along with every queries you will type in. Do not rely on "no logs" policies as the VPNs providers have to comply with their cou try laws.AOSP doesn't include any modifications with bloatware and things like that, and other custom roms should not have "google code". However, custom roms need proprietary blobs to work on the hardware on which it is installed. The only true free (as in freedom) android rom is Replicant which supports a little devices (around 10). So, every custom rom you will install, by default, won't have "google code" (only proprietary blobs needed for the hardware to work properly.). 	
9274	 SODYOUTHEN	 Bugger all evidence of that so far. 	
9275	 ryanerickson	 Not an expert by any means, but I run NextCloud for my own storage needs and I can say there has got to me some sort of “phoning home” being done. However, this doesn’t mean your data isn’t safe. I say this only because it does update checks periodically as to do that, it’s gotta phone home. I haven’t any issues with NextCloud over the last six months (save for my own tinkering) and it’s pretty solid. Even better, I run it on a Raspberry Pi 3 with Ubuntu... little power consumption and its mine- in my own home. 	
9276	 Skipper_Blue	 So piwik, a tool that I use on my own websites, is actually malicious software installed on end user computers designed to steal personal data such as browsing history, passwords, or email addresses? 	
9277	 Geminii27	 I'm also free to block attempts to spy on me. If they don't like them, they can stop putting that in their software.	
9278	 Geminii27	 &gt;if you download and use Vivaldi and care about your privacy...then you won't be using it the way they would like you to.	
9279	 Skipper_Blue	 I specifically use piwik for site analytics on my websites because I know that the data about my visitors is not shared with other ad companies like Google. It's nice to be able to get bulk data about my users without feeling bad about telling some advertiser about my user's habits. 	
9280	 Geminii27	 Or, alternatively, block the spyware contamination and use the browser as an actual browser.	
9281	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
9282	 SODYOUTHEN	 Yeah, because fuck the people who work on making this for free for you from having anything in return, right? 	
9283	 i010011010	 They also uniquely fingerprint you within the program, so IP is irrelevant.  It's just one point of data but nearly as useful for tracking purposes.	
9284	 potifar	 I'd bet they just use the data to gauge which platforms/screen resolutions/markets etc. to focus on. Back when I worked with a lot of these same people at Opera Software, we used similar data to decide when to phase out support for old versions of operating systems and such.	
9285	 i010011010	 The founder talks a big deal about privacy.  https://twitter.com/jonsvtYou can lookup his AMAs here on Reddit, blog posts etc.I do think this is a major contradiction to find the browser is tracking users without so much an opt out.	
9286	 ma590495405	 Don't they just have Google Analytics on the add-ons page?	
9287	 i010011010	 And yet somehow Duckduckgo manages to thrive without it.  Funny how that works.	
9288	 merger3	 No, but most of the ones listed there do.	
9289	 potifar	 &gt; Hell, if analytics are supposed to improve their browser, instead of making guesses based on data, they could actually use their forum's wildly busy suggestions forum for ideas.Users are noisy, some are much noisier than others. When deciding whether to continue support for an old OS or whether to spend precious developer hours on making sure the browser works optimally at a 640x480 resolution, it's much better to use objective numbers from analytics than to listen to a vocal minority in the forums.

9292	 Kendos-Kenlen	 Maybe, I am not sure how much it is used in Firefox.	
9293	 blue-meteor	 If ppl read those stuff. Most tech companies would go bankrupt. Probably that’s a good thing.	
9294	 FeatheryAsshole	 Firefox talks big about privacy, as well. It seems anyone who collects slightly less data than Google fancies themselves a privacy advocate, these days.	
9295	 Exaskryz	 That vocal minority are the users who are vocal enough to keep recommending your products. Ignoring them achieves the opposite where people vocally protest your products; that is why I recommend against LineageOS because you lose your functionality of hardware on your phone, including, oh, IDK, LTE data...	
9296	 postlapsar	 The Tor Project is a registered charity. You can donate money and get a deduction on your taxes. Tor was created by the navy to protect communications. And it is still used for official comms. Hardly illegal.	
9297	 potifar	 I'm not saying they should be ignored, I'm just saying that having some objective data to help you make these decisions is always useful. It's all too easy to lose sight of the big picture when you've got a couple of vocal enthusiasts shouting you down on the forums.	
9298	 gandonblyat	 Actually I have the similar problem. Network is extremely slow and I haven't seen such a continuous slow connection in Tor before. Selektor and AdvOR type of third party software also does not change the situation at all.	
9299	 seaninthecity	 I’d have to run something quite hefty - currently on a 32tb raid 5 (24tb technically), wish all my stuff would fit on a simple Nextcloud box haha. Whatever I build has got to be big, scaleable + private and safe. Thank you both for getting back, I guess I could run a VM on my QNAP, but will probably move towards a build. I hope responses keep pouring in here!Edit: by Nextcloud box what I mean is - the single drive Nextcloud product they offer - or any simple one drive enclosure / build.

9302	 parad0xchild	 Well duckduckgo does have some minimal tracking for revenue (like referral linking), and it basically just skins other search engines.A lot easier to use other solutions, add a small profit layer on top, with some extra features to get a customer base.	
9303	 postlapsar	 Government regulation has limits. If everyone took some basic steps, like installing a few browser extensions, this would end. Most people will be happy, but will not look for it themselves. When I see people who know little about tech, I suggest they install these extensions. And guess what? They keep using them - forever. But they wont do it on their own. 	
9304	 shiba_arata	 See this https://github.com/mozilla/addons-frontend/issues/2785	
9305	 Facelessnotnameless	 It amazes me how people still use closed source cloud based password managers and expect it to be secure or even trust worthy.If there's one thing you shouldn't do when it comes to security it's store your passwords online. Open source and "locally stored" is the only option when something as sensitive as your passwords are involved.	
9306	 i010011010	 Doesn't give you the right to help yourself to whatever data.  What if company X decides it would give them even better insight if they scanned your drives?  Including everything network attached, and reports it all online?  Because there's a game out there called Osu that does precisely this (because it catches cheaters, of course).  And their fans are just as vocal about why _this_ is acceptable practice as everybody here thumping the terms of service and saying BUT YOU AGREED!!!!The user should have the right to say they don't want to participate.  I don't give a shit if they want to allow people to send them every bit of info down to their social security number and Facebook password.  I should be able to uncheck that box in settings.

9310	 AngeLusFr	 Thanks for all your replyA lot of detail for those things that will help me a lot :)To answered about waterfox : no, it still under Firefox  57.0.3I just noticed that you didn't answered to my ideas about windows : "Windows : This is why I though I would just download an old ISO of Windows 7 that include every update before they include their telemetry in it I also plan to disable Windows Update completly"Do you think the security risk is too high for the removal of those spyware ?	
9311	 ASunz	 Switch to Linux (or any *BSD if you're feeling brave) as soon as possible, but ~~[DO NOT use Ubuntu or any of its derivatives](https://github.com/nylira/prism-break/issues/334), this includes Linux Mint~~ (Edit: read reply below and proceed at your own risk if using *buntu). If QubesOS is too much of a hassle, there's Debian and Fedora, both stable, well documented and supported. Learn how Linux distributions work, learn how to configure your stuff. It's really not as hard as the mainstream media makes it out to be. Practice on a virtual machine if you have to.If you really understand what you're up against, if you *really* care about your privacy and basic rights, the lack of games in Linux should be trivial (and there's lots of games you can still play). Same for YouTube (though hooktube is indeed pretty good).Mandatory readings are [prism-break](https://prism-break.org/en/categories/gnu-linux/) and [privacytools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/).

9313	 potifar	 &gt; Doesn't give you the right to help yourself to whatever data.Did I say that it does?I agree that it would be nice to have an opt-out, although I honestly wouldn't use it myself. I suppose the opt-out would have to be from automatic updates altogether, as that functionality requires you to at least tie information about your operating system to your IP address.	
9314	 thrower65	 Security ≠ privacy	
9315	 LastUserNameDrowned	 Oh, come on. "My cat clicked 'I agree' on the EULA" is an even dumber excuse than "my dog ate my homework."And if you're concerned about privacy, you probably should lock your computer when you step away from it to prevent unauthorized access, be it from people or pets.	
9316	 i010011010	 I started using Net Limiter pretty early in its lifetime, and it's actually one of the things that first got me into privacy and cyber security.In the 90s, programs didn't report everything we do online.  If we caught a program phoning home, devs were shamed into changing it.  Now days this behavior is the norm and it's a hopeless struggle.NL let me take control of my system because it blocks connectivity on a per-app basis.  Don't want your notepad talking online?  Block it completely.  Want to use program X that needs to be online to work, but don't want it talking to Yahoo's tracking servers?  Block the process from connecting to the Yahoo subnet(s).Mostly it will show you just how much connectivity your system is communicating, how many processes are unnecessarily talking online, and the sheer abundance+scope of it.	
9317	 thrower65	 You make a great point. Is there anything like an x86 UMPC that can run Linux distros? Or something smaller than a netbook. I've always wanted something that's very portable but also a PC. 	
9318	 stingrays_are_fish	 One could argue that Facebook is relatively open about collecting every piece of data they can get.	
9319	 Craftkorb	 Spyware, software to spy.  Spying is the act of information retrieval without the opponents direct knowledge of you doing so.  This includes making blanket statements like "Tracking your activity".  It doesn't matter where and how it's installed, its job is to spy upon users.  By that definition, piwik is spyware, yes.  Doesn't matter if you host it yourself or not.	
9320	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; I have yet to understand HOW corporations/websites can actually track me.Many, many, many ways. Everything from specific characteristics about your browser and your computer, to hidden signals broadcast in stores you shop in and on television you watch. &gt;  For example can a website see what other sites I bookmarked? No. Not under normal conditions (meaning you don't have any rogue add-ons installed and don't use so-called 'social bookmarking' services). 	
9321	 thrower65	 Any custom ROM should be fine.	
9322	 thrower65	 Are they actually off? Like is it just software, 'off', or is it physically switching the hardware off?	
9323	 bro_can_u_even_carve	 Security is a prerequisite to privacy.	
9324	 i010011010	 That was really supposed to be rhetorical/conjecture.Disabling auto updates is a trivial sacrifice so long as we can download an offline installer and do it manually.  It's when you see companies revoking our ability to install offline that we should be more suspicious they're up-to-no-good.

9325	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt;  I just bought a ProtonVPN planDon't use a VPN, use Tor. It's free (though you can take the money you would've otherwise been paying to the snake oil VPN merchant, and donate it to the Tor project), and more anonymous. &gt; But, I've read somewhere that it's still possible to track a user via WiFi networks. Apparently, when you connect, some information is passed around that reveals the location of the device and websites and services are able to read it out to circumvent VPNs and all other efforts.

9338	 blastuponsometerries	 Firefox Telemetry is done in house and is opt-in.Google Analytics is only used on some Mozilla websites (like addons).  So there is no google analytics inside the browser!The websites will not use google analytics if you are in private browsing, have *do not track* enabled, tracking protection enabled, or have a blocker like uBlock.

9345	 torpcoms	 So it is first-party spyware rather than third-party spyware. It is also (hopefully) more restrained than normal spyware, since it is only *supposed to* collect:&gt; a message [sent] using HTTPS directly to our servers located in Iceland every 24 hours containing this [installation-unique] ID, version, cpu architecture, screen resolution and time since last message. We anonymize the IP address of Vivaldi users by removing the last octet of the IP address from your Vivaldi client then we store the resolved approximate location after using a local geoip lookup[src](https://vivaldi.com/privacy/browser/)Its better than a lot of what we see happen elsewhere, but I can understand calling this spyware behaviour when it is not an opt-in. Hell, *Ghostery* is even better than this.

User data represents significant value now days.  Just ask Flurry (sold to Yahoo for reported $200 million) or Onavo (reported $200 million buy out by Facebook).  There are tons of others, but these are two off the top of my head.  Their only product is building these data gathering, user tracking platforms and then getting them incorporated into millions of apps.

9370	 i010011010	 So the NAS needs to be accessible _remotely_?That's really key here.  Any NAS can be safely run on a private LAN.  As soon as you have it talking online, you need to be far more comprehensive though.Many routers can have rules set that prohibits certain ports, IPs or even domains from being accessed from within the network.  You can set any device to a static IP then do something like prevent said NAS from talking to amazonaws.com, or using port 21.So best thing is to set up an internal network that captures traffic and use that to shape rules.Alternatively, keep said NAS on a local network and setup your own VPN to tunnel into your own home network while it sits on the other side of a firewall.  That way the resource isn't available _online_, but only accessible within its local network to yourself credentialed through that VPN.	
9371	 debridezilla	 Manufacturers assume (safely) that people don't read privacy policies. In this case, to read that policy after you download the brower, you have to be online--it's nowhere in the software. And the link to it isn't under About, it's a link off a ToS page. That's hardly "up front."	
9372	 thereisnoprivacy	 You understand the problem with asking this right?You want an online SMS service that works. Sites that require SMS verification tend to block online SMS services. Services that are widely known become blocked faster. Therefore sharing such a service will lead to it being used more and in turn blocked faster.If you spend half an hour digging through search results though, and then another hour haplessly trying various services, you'll eventually find one that works. After you do, will you share it publicly so that it can be blocked and next time you need it you'll have to spend time looking for another working one all over again?	
9373	 Fahad78	 Well then Dual Booting is fine.	
9374	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I used Samsung Secure Erase and then went full disk encryption using LUKS. Now I don't have to worry about my data at rest.There is no way to clear an individual file on an SSD with certainty given how the controller distributes writes across the drive (for wear leveling). You would need open-source firmware for the SSD and a way to interact with that firmware. So you now have a file that you need gone. It sucks, but you need to make a full-backup to an external drive, wipe the drive using secure erase, and create a new partition scheme with LUKS or veracrypt to protect yourself against this in the future.Even Secure Erase sees some people say its not enough. I'm not an expert, but apparently some think data could be recovered given enough effort. I doubt it, but be forewarned. I made the switch to FDE with the Snowden leaks- I had no data that was illegal, so I just backed up, used samsung's secure erase, and then went luks. If there were residual pieces of data, I'm pretty sure the years of usage have *probably* wiped them all out via wear leveling.The best strategy is always to immediately encrypt the moment you get a drive. Then you are *positive* your data is secure at rest. I've done this now with all external harddrives I've purchased since, and it gives good peace of mind.	
9375	 uph	 I'd recommend using Ubuntu and selecting full disk encryption during install. 	
9376	 torpcoms	 Some people, OP included apparently, would call analytics' behaviour "spyware" - and unless it is opt-in, I'm in agreement.Sure it is first-party spyware rather than third-party spyware, but that doesn't change the reality of what the software does. Maybe you don't mind a daily phone home, but when it defaulted to this behaviour without asking you or informing you somewhere other than the EULA, that sounds like spyware to me.	
9377	 nothingduploading	 Give me a break.	
9378	 DidNotTryAvcadoToast	 who? I looked it up and couldn't find out	
9379	 Szymas255	 For youtube you could export your subscriptions as rss feeds or use newpipe/skytube. If you want to switch to linux any os will be good but I think linux mint or ubuntu will be the best. If you are a more advanced user you should consider debian as your choice, but privacy wise it doesn't matter. I don't think mozilla is evil and untrust worthy but if you want to switch off firefox brave seems to be a nice alternative. Self hosting a dns server could be a good idea, it's really simple on linux but I have no idea about windows. It would be great if you could switch to wire/signal/matrix.org client(riot.im) as your instant messenger. I can recomend disroot.org as a free privacy friendly email provider. They also give you 4 gb storage and a matrix serverIf you find keepass to be hard to use I can personaly recommend bitwarden as password manager	
9380	 torpcoms	 The unique ID is changed on re-install though, right? The IP leakage is a much bigger problem than that, unless the ID is generated from some additional private data rather than being a random number.	
9381	 nutpantz	 So if lineage uses the Google dns servers that's not an issue? That they know every internet location your device connects to?If lineage uses network location from Google every time location is used is not an issue?If Google gets the fingerprint and signature of every app installed from app verification, that's not an issue?Google play services is the visible part of the iceberg.I know my lineage nougat running on my a2wifi tries to connects to Google constantly but right now it's an offline device for reading.	
9382	 lo________________ol	 Maybe OP got their wires crossed on that. 	
9383	 i010011010	 I haven't tested this so no clue.  I've seen so many fingerprinting generated by unique hardware etc, if they want persistence then it's easy to get.And even if a user deletes it--let's say they change systems.  They'll probably restore their browser (especially if said browser has a cloud backup feature).  And guess what, that key is almost always included too.	
9384	 Szymas255	 You could try to setup a gpu passthrough to vm and block microsoft's ip. Also dual booting windows just for games isn't bad. All microsoft will know is that you switched to linux, play games and your hardware. /u/postlapsar I disagree. If people want to keep privacy without inconviniences they can. They won't stay as private as people who only use tor and fully open source software but they will be more private than people who aren't doing anything. And that's a good thing	
9385	 torpcoms	 Well Piwik is a web analytics package, so the browser is the analytics app here, Piwik is just the backend. If it were opt-in, I would be willing to call this an analytics feature.It's setting it *against the user expectation* that makes it spyware.A daily survey system is not an expected part of "A Browser for Our Friends"	
9386	 Szymas255	 Wasn't quad9 recently posted here as a data selling dns?	
9387	 Szymas255	 Fedora is a really good distro but it's bad for newcomers because of selinux which can break a lot of stuff, there beeing a lot smaller community than ubuntu and there not beeing any propertiary repos	
9388	 torpcoms	 That's great, but collecting *and phoning home* this data as anything other than an opt-in is spyware behaviour. The only reason you don't make something like this opt-in is because you know that the majority of users would opt out.	
9389	 seaninthecity	 Wow, this is some seriously useful advice... thank you. While it doesn't exactly highlight any commercial solutions that give me the kind of peace of mind I'd like from my 5 questions... it gives me great ideas for when I build my own setup with something like FreeNAS / Nextcloud.The NAS def does have to be accesible remotely - at least when I'm traveling.	
9390	 seaninthecity	 Really good chat happening in my cross post on the actual Nextcloud forums - https://help.nextcloud.com/t/how-does-nextcloud-weigh-up-against-qnap-synology-drobo-with-regards-to-privacy/26527/2	
9391	 Szymas255	 Isn't this common knowledge?	
9392	 Szymas255	 it is google free but I recommend installing microg version of it for compatibility with more android apps	
9393	 torpcoms	 Yes, but he has a point.Analytics behaviour is unexpected (except cynically) in a "power-user" program marketed as "a browser for our friends".Because it is unexpected, unless you announce it or make it opt-in only, this kind of behaviour is akin to spyware.	
9394	 torpcoms	 &gt; So piwik, a tool that I use on my own websites, is actually malicious software installed on end user computers designed to steal personal data such as browsing history~~, passwords, or email addresses~~?Yes, if you are not telling your users that this is happening, it is doing the job of a spyware program.	
9395	 torpcoms	 I think it is important to nuance this with what the user is expecting; specifically in Vivaldi's case, they market themselves as for "power-users" and "a browser for our friends". They also talk [with concern for user privacy](https://twitter.com/vivaldibrowser/status/957564538811047936), and it is because of this expectation that they create, that having **not opt-in** analytics is so damning.	
9396	 potifar	 To have automatic software updates at all they need to at least phone home the operating system version, browser version and CPU architecture along with the update request. The only thing they're sending that isn't strictly necessary is the screen resolution.My guess is they didn't make it opt-in because the vast majority of people want to have their software updated automatically.	
9397	 Szymas255	 It doesn't seem far fetched because you can use it for localization on most android phones... Mozilla even has a closed(due to legal stuff) database for this kind of stuff

9406	 i010011010	 Go run a brand new Firefox install under a firewall sometime, and note how much connectivity comes out of it.  And then consistently during runtime.  It's a lot.Old Firefox if you go way back to something like v17 was fine.  Modern Firefox stopped caring.  The opt out in the settings doesn't actually disable it.  If you want Firefox to stop phoning home, you need to manage the about:config and actually null a bunch of https strings so the browser can't find their servers.	
9407	 AngeLusFr	 /u/Fahad78 Thats the plan :)/u/Szymas255 I heard about GPU Passthrough and I will take a look at it, but I don't think the performance will be really good compared to a Dual Boot	
9408	 FFakery	 just to enlighten those who trust tutanota, their admins have access to all emails and all accounts. They store passwords 20days after deleting your account. I like the fact they dont want sms or payment verification.	
9409	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; Even Secure Erase sees some people say its not enough. I'm not an expert, but apparently some think data could be recovered given enough effort. I doubt it, but be forewarned.The issue is that secure erase is not reliable. Tests have shown that various vendors fuck up the implementation, and that's only in cases where you can actually perform verification in the first place. If you're relying on secure erase you have to trust the vendor not only to not have any firmware backdoors, but more importantly to not just have a buggy implementation. When you run secure erase (assuming you can get it to run in the first place), you're basically winging it any saying 'huh, I hope *Vendor X* did it properly', and there's often no way to easily ensure they did do it properly, and so months after you think you've secure-deleted a drive, you find a curious note in the version changes of a drive utilities update pack that says something wonderfully vague and inconspicuous like "fixed issues with ATA secure erase commands", and then you find yourself doing a 'wait, what?' double take :).Attempting to use other commands to sanitize SSDs like `trim`is similarly problematic because they too come with various non-obvious caveats.To use one potential  'gotcha' example out of many: if you've hooked up your SSD via USB, or PCI, or via anything besides (primary) SATA for that matter, you'll typically be out of luck.The bottom line is that if drive sanitization is important to you (you *really* need those files gone), you absolutely cannot rely on deletion via drive commands (or deletion software solutions). The solution is as you said:&gt; The best strategy is always to immediately encrypt the moment you get a drive.	
9410	 AngeLusFr	 Yes I'm really a beginer with Linux (I only installed it some months ago for testing purpose (at that time I already though about leaving windows))	
9411	 torpcoms	 I haven't read through its source, but I am fairly sure that `dnf` for example (what I use), doesn't need to do something like this. You could figure out my architecture or existing version based on what files I download, but all the decide-what-to-download logic can be done client-side.You can't do as reliable analytics though, without a unique ID. If you want to track me or my installation you should ask me to opt in, or not do it at all.	
9412	 PuzzleheadedMeaning	 yeah ubuntu made some bad decissions about including amazon, but they changed it. your search is now opt-in. the only thing left is a shortcut to amazon on the taskbar which you can easily remove with two clicks. Ubuntu is the most user friendly Linux OS. Nobody who is intressted in privacy is going from Windows 10 directly to QubesOS. Ubuntu is a good starting point in the linux world, but if keep bullshiting at it and recomending advanced linux distros, users will get frustrated and will stick with windows.	
9413	 FFakery	 thx for the addons suggestion. About tor, are you trying to say that you can access clearnet sites with tor? not just onion ones? Its been long time ago since I used tor.I love the idea of qubes, for about freaking 2 years, still not using it, why? I still struggle with instaling vpn with ip tables and cli, it bites my mind too long that I would even consider paying someone to walk me through it.

9421	 i010011010	 I do read privacy policies.But I also know the behavior of programs I'm running.  I've been using Vivaldi since the very first beta release.  The only unwanted connectivity I've ever seen was it phoning home to Google servers, so I've always kept their subnets blocked from Vivaldi and allowed the rest.This must have come more recently, I'd have observed it otherwise.  So it doesn't matter what rights they granted themselves in their policy.  This is newer behavior in the software that presents a security gap that didn't exist before.	
9422	 torpcoms	 Yeah, bit strange, but we all have our quirks.If the most misuse they do is collect names for their proxy baptisms, that's not that bad; it's the DNA samples and data I'm worried about, and to what bidder they do or will go. Especially if the company disappears or is bought.

9429	 Captain-Capybara	 The idea you have about installing Windows 7 updates only up to a point is not a good idea. Security updates are far more valuable to you than not sending data to a company for their use. You will be far more upset if you lose control of your machine to a vulnerability that has been patched out than if Microsoft advertises a particular game to you in your Start Menu. Also: you should know that games often collect information, and so do a lot of DRM wrappers. If you sincerely don’t want to be tracked, you should only play FLOSS games. In any opsec environment, the human is almost always the weakest link. You cannot expect to make only the changes you find pleasant or desirable and get the full benefit of the end results you want. Do you get any marketing emails? Do you ever click on them? You’re being tracked. Have you ensured that tracking pixels are not being placed? Again, tracking. There are even cross device pixels that can follow you from pc to tablet to phone and back again. Being subject to “a little tracking” is no better than a lot. It’s incredibly easy to build a profile on someone from only a few tracker data points. The difference is that instead of being totally accurate, your profile will only be damn near totally accurate.

9446	 Fahad78	 Being vulnerable is worse.What's wrong with it being located in Germany? I know they are in Fourteen Eyes, but if your data is encrypted from your system, can't be read by the email service provider and Key Disclosure laws don't apply then you are fine.

9448	 Exaskryz	 Have to look into it. I used Pale Moon, then they fucked up the UI. So Waterfox might be the same problem.	
9449	 FeatheryAsshole	 Matter of perspective. You will probably see Firefox Quantum's new UI in Waterfox, but IMO everything changed for the better. They're following Firefox rather closely, which is why they're the only fork that comes with all the performance gains since Firefox 52.

9451	 MegadoomerX	 I don't mean to be disrespectful, but that sounds overly critical to me. I would love to use Tor, but it's very slow and since you can't stay on one specific exit node, it's impossible to stay logged in on all sites.  In the end, I'm basically just a regular consumer online and not an internationally wanted whistleblower or something, so I don't really need that "untrackable" routing. Besides, I've read that just using Tor by itself can't guarantee for full anonymity anyway.  I would definitely pay and use Tor with faster speed, but since they don't/can't offer such a service, I figured better leave the bandwidth open for those who need it and get a full speed VPN. Plus, the Proton people seem rather trustworthy, to me.	
9452	 FFakery	 I havent read thread that long in a very long time :D so there seems to be problem with pure os (not speaking of librem hardware, that does not even deserve mentioning) , so the obfuscated systemd should be the problem.Maybe the fsf was not compromised only mislead because they overlooked the obfuscated systemd issue? Im now wondering, some people say that Trisquel along with some other distros are not safe, because they are outdated and lack updates which can compromise the security. Im wondering what would be the best option for me to have free and reasonably secure os, I would appreciate advice, parabola and hyperbola seems very similar, at least in look 	
9453	 Exaskryz	 &gt;You will probably see Firefox Quantum's new UI in Waterfox, Fuck, probably not for me thenIf in addition to the crummy UI that is not as readily customizable anymore, they are adopting the idea of breaking legacy addons, it's definitely not for me. Privacy is great, but functionality is important too, which is why I can't use modern firefox.

9456	 N03y3s	 Indeed, you can access clearnet websites with Tor but you shouldn't use a VPN nor login with your credentials on a website as it will take away your anonymity (with the exception that if you created an account THROUGH the Tor protocol and ONLY login while using Tor, then you will be anonymous on that particular website because you will have an account that cannot be traced back to your personal identity.)If you are using Qubes OS, like me, here is a link to use firewall rules ( https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/firewall/ )And here is the part to use vpn along with it ( https://www.qubes-os.org/doc/vpn/ ).If I misunderstood and you aren't using Qubes OS but you indeed use an another GNU/Linux distribution, then you can install a GNU/Linux firewall with graphical user interface. I would recommend installing gufw and ufw which is a firewall with a GUI (you should be aware that you can also use it in a command line interface).	
9457	 torpcoms	 You can track someone's device across networks via the physical MAC address, but the websites you are connecting to are not the ones doing this.The MAC address is only needed for your Ethernet or WiFi chip to talk to the router. The site you visit should only ever see your IP address, not your MAC address. If you use VPN/Tor/etc tunnel proxy, the IP address a site sees will be that of the tunnel exit. So if you use a tunnel of some kind, someone can still track your MAC address, but they can't associate it with the tunnel exit IP that you appear to be browsing with. *Apart from timing attacks*---I haven't heard of WiFi tracking that can be done by websites, but if you didn't use a proxy, the router could theoretically tell the site you visit your MAC address, since it is able to watch traffic and see your IP address (well, *its IP address*, since a WiFi network is probably using NAT - making it the same as a tunnel exit).	
9458	 IWantToCobainMyself	 Why you said not to use vpn on top of tor?

9460	 AnonymousAurele	 Thanks for clarification.[Here’s](https://vivaldi.com/source/?lang=en) Vivaldi’s source code.	
9461	 FeatheryAsshole	 well, Waterfox wants to keep XUL support as long as possible, so you'll be good on that front. Other than that, I use tree style tabs, which completely overhauls Firefox's tab management and -display. Based on that, the customizability with web extension addons can't be that bad. Functionality-wise, I don't think there's much of a difference between post-Quantum UI and pre-Quantum UI. It just has a slightly different design.	
9462	 scarcerepentance	 I know that Piwik is a first-party tool to gather statistics. Sites that do not want to expose their users to Google might use Piwik instead of google-analytics, and I am OK with it.  But if whole browser uses Piwik, that means the browser sends every fucking piece of information about you somewhere... each site, each request... everything. THIS IS CALLED *SPYWARE*	
9463	 luetage	 You are a noob. Any half decent adblock extension or host file implementation will stop piwik cleanly. And if you aren't willing to use any of these you are getting tracked everywhere else too. Just like here on reddit right this instance.

9471	 torpcoms	 You'll probably find that most of us here agree with Rule 3:&gt; The promotion of closed source privacy software is not welcome in /r/privacy. By its nature you can not verify easily that it does what it claims and as a result this puts your privacy and security at riskand will strongly advise you to use something open source; like FreeNAS and Nextcloud as you mentioned.Any advice on proprietary software will probably be in the interest of [harm reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harm_reduction). :)	
9472	 DanTheMan74	 I have serious doubts what you're saying is actually true. WebExtensions are by design seriously limited in what they can affect (mostly for good reasons) and I doubt connections by the browser-core such as this count among it. My guess is that the only way to stop this type of analytics is by using a local proxy server where the user is able to set an appropriate filter rule. The simpler method of using the hosts file should work too, but it possibly adds more limitations/breakage.	
9473	 Fahad78	 Well official GApps collects data and what not, but I am unable to confirm whether MicroG does or not, have you ever audited the code? Asking because if you haven't then neither of us can confirm that they do not.	
9474	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
9475	 DanTheMan74	 The same privacy policy for their browser has been in effect (with the relevant passage present) since May of 2017. Before that point they didn't have a separate privacy policy for the downloaded software, at least going by what I could find through the Internet Archive.Did they track their users or did the installation create a unique identifier before that point? Did they possibly only mention it during the setup in earlier versions? I don't know, but it shouldn't be too hard to test by installing an older version of the browser and using a packet analyzer such as Wireshark.	
9476	 Szymas255	 It does send minimal required data and no, I haven't audited the code myself

I don't feel like I'm the product on those projects, but you have to scale back you're expectations of features quite a lot. Major reason why I'm still using Forefoxost of the time despite their recent inclusion of Pocket and other decisions like that...

9488	 N03y3s	 I said so because, to me, a VPN do not protect your privacy even though it encrypt your Internet traffic because the VPN provider can log your queries and get your real IP. Therefore, relying on "no logs" policy gives you a falls sense of privacy because those companies can lie to you and, also, they have to comply with their respective country laws.This is how that happened (I don't know if he had used a VPN over Tor but this is a great example on how a VPN can't protect your privacy [the only way to be sure the service is trustworthy is by self-hosting it.): https://thehackernews.com/2017/10/no-logs-vpn-service-security_8.html?m=1

9498	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; It's still hilarious that people are tracking their steps and whatnot while in secure areas...This is a serious privacy risk not just for 'secure areas' but for any areas.

9503	 commentfreely	 I don't think the sub is too very extreme. Yes, there is a set of principles that aren't up for debate (e.g. closed source is by definition insecure) but in terms of what people should do to protect their own privacy, that's hardly proscriptive.You're encouraged to learn and find your own level of comfort. I think the confusion may come in when someone suggests their MS box is "secure". That may be triggering.	
9504	 N03y3s	 As @uph said, it is a work in progress. On their freedom-roadmap ( https://puri.sm/learn/freedom-roadmap/ ), they are at the coreboot bios released step in which they are actively trying to remove mystery code from the board such as the Intel Management Engine, which has access to the entire system and thus bypass every security measures put in place ( https://puri.sm/posts/measuring-the-intel-me-to-create-a-more-secure-computer/ ), the Intel FSP, which is a binary blob that is used to initialize the bootloader ( https://puri.sm/posts/primer-to-reverse-engineering-intel-fsp/ ) and, later, the remaining components which are the Embedded controler and the Video BIOS. After this is done, they will port Libreboot, which will replace Coreboot as it runs only with open source firmware. After the port is done and functional, they should receive FSF "RYF" endorsement as the only devices to ever receive it are the one running Libreboot. Even with that certification, they will continue beyond that to free the drive's firmware and release their schematics so that everyone can reproduce it.It should also be noted that they will use TPM + Heads which will give an even better security than what Purism already offers you. This comes from the official Heads website ( http://osresearch.net/ ): "Heads is not just another Linux distribution – it combines physical hardening of specific hardware platforms and flash security features with custom coreboot firmware and a Linux boot loader in ROM. This moves the root of trust into the write-protected region of the SPI flash and prevents further software modifications to the bootup code (and on platforms that support it, Bootguard can protect against many hardware attacks as well). Controlling the first instruction the CPU executes allows Heads to measure every step of the boot firmware and configuration into the TPM, which makes it possible to attest to the user or a remote system that the machine has not been tampered with. While modern Intel CPUs require binary blobs to boot, these non-Free components are included in the measurements and are at least guaranteed to be unchanging. Once the system is in a known good state, the TPM is used as a hardware key storage to decrypt the drive.Additionally, the hypervisor, kernel and initrd images are signed by keys controlled by the user, and the OS uses a signed, immutable root filesystem so that any software exploits that attempt to gain persistence will be detected. While all of these firmware and software changes don’t secure the system against every possible attack vector, they address several classes of attacks against the boot process and physical hardware that have been neglected in traditional installations, hopefully raising the difficulty beyond what most attackers are willing to spend."	
9505	 The_BlackRabbit	 Are you using anything else apart NoScrip? Like Tor or any VPN to hide your location, or maybe other extension. I don't think is an issue related to NoScrip tbh. Being using it long time with no captchas, so must be something else.	
9506	 thereisnoprivacy	 The problem is not with NoScript. The problem is that Cloudflare is a huge privacy risk and that website operators need to be pressured to not use it. NoScript is simply preventing Cloudflare scripts from running. It is doing its job. If a website is inaccessible because of it, complain to the website owner, not to NoScript.And with regard to CF, I'm not just talking about them men-in-middling websites, I'm also talking about egregious data breaches like [this](http://fortune.com/2017/02/24/cloudflare-leak-bug-sensitive-information/) and their absurd response of trying to downplay the severity of the risk. 	
9507	 one_is_the_loneliest	 I use the Strava feature that disables tracking near my house, so I feel reasonably safe. Also, how would that predator know *when* someone goes for a run? If they know their prey well enough to know that, then it doesn't so much matter whether Strava includes that information in the heat map.My particular area doesn't have any info as to specific houses, it's just the streets in front of said houses. I live on a corner where there are two ways to get to the running path, and both seem equally tracked (I take one on my bike commute and the other when I go to the store or whatever).	
9508	 MegadoomerX	 I understand your position, but nothing I've read in that thread and its sources fully convinces me.  Protonmail currently has a couple million users according to Wikipedia right now and these are the only two instances that surfaced so far? It will be difficult for the authorities to perpetuate mass surveillance, if they have to present each case individually and in some cases, this might be legitimate. The case with the banned account is a little concerning, as it's possible that they may have acted upon a forged poster. Then again, it wasn't a "regular" mail-address, so the decision seems plausible.  In all honesty, seeing that Protonmail *does* cooperate with the US authorities and doesn't allow criminals to use and promote their service makes me feel even better about using it, because services that protect illegal activities usually don't last very long.  Regarding their claims, that's a little unfortunate, although not unsettling, either. Many email providers do much worse things to sell their companies.  After all, I have to trust someone, since I can't run my own mail server. Protonmail still seems like the best bet. What do you suggest?

There are tons of other scenarios that highlight the privacy risk, if this one was unconvincing for you: tracking the route someone takes home from school or work, finding out that someone went from a given house to a strip club or 'massage parlor' or any other potentially objectionable spot, and so on. 	
9510	 Fahad78	 My mistake sorry, was meant to say something else lol.	
9511	 SCphotog	 The people defending this bullshit make me want to fucking puke.	
9512	 void4232	 Thanks for replies, the reason i thought it was NoScript is because i belive i read something about that blocking java scripts can fuck with cloudflares thing and it happen just after i had gotten NoScript. And no i havent installed any other addons except adblock, lastpass and RES	
9513	 luetage	 There are 2 things in the original discussion. The implementation of piwik on vivaldi forums and the actual information sent to Vivaldi servers in Iceland from the browser itself. Don't mix them up. We used to have a switch to turn the tracking in browser off, but it has been disabled since a year. We had a long discussion about this on the forums back then. The point is Vivaldi is a small company that needs this information badly. The information the browser sends was described above. It's the bare minimum. That you guys start crying here one year after the fact, while being on the data mining machine that is reddit is a little ridiculous. Show some support for Vivaldi's efforts and understand that they have no malicious intent, quite the opposite.	
9514	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt;  i read something about that blocking java scripts can fuck with cloudflares thingIt does. And from a privacy perspective, that is a good thing.An from a usability perspective, the fault is on the shoulders of the web administrator crippling their website. Complain to them. 	
9515	 Szymas255	 MicroG itself has probably been audited and I've built the rom for my device myself	
9516	 void4232	 But since i uninstalled noscrips and all websites scripts can run now shouldnt cloudflare captchas be removed now?	
9517	 Geminii27	 That doesn't even *remotely* justify spyware and you know it.	
9518	 void4232	 And also, this is for 90% of the sites i visit and it would take a long time to request every single website to remove this function that could otherwhise maybe be usefull to them?	
9519	 Geminii27	 Eh, I never use the Vivaldi site, so it's not an issue for me.	
9520	 one_is_the_loneliest	 I live on a corner and have a couple avid cyclists and runners in my neighborhood, so my "house" shows up.Honestly, if someone is looking to rob me or someone else in my neighborhood, they'd just show up during normal office hours (10am to 4 PM to avoid early and late working shifts). If someone is looking to hurt me or my family, they'd break in at night when we're asleep or sleepy. If someone is looking for my address, they can deduce my neighborhood pretty early from talking to anyone who knows me.I do what I can to limit what personal data is available online, but it doesn't really protect me completely, and Strava is far from the biggest source of my personal data.	
9521	 thereisnoprivacy	 CF could have blacklisted your IP, or they have something cached down the pipeline (their systems are not open source, so no one really knows what they're doing). Try loading the page through a different browser, for starters. Then send the site owner an email advising them not to use CF. 	
9522	 void4232	 It gives me captchas in other browsers too.	
9523	 anonwhodis	 I'm pretty sure Microsoft has included some back doors for "national security". 	
9524	 OnlyWallsOfText	 I'm going to back you up on this. A VPN is excellent at keeping your information away from corporations, but not so much against governments as they have more power over the VPN providers.[Corporations are the bigger threat to privacy](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7td2oy/corporations_seen_as_a_bigger_threat_to_data/), as they sell the information they collect, unlike governments. A corporation is also more likely to be tracking you, because certain corporations track everyone (Google, Microsoft, etc). Certain governments (e.g. the US) do their tracking through automated systems, and don't act on the majority of that information. Governments also do not profit from extracting every bit of use out of every bit of information.However, this is assuming your VPN lets you regularly change the IP it routes your information through, and is up to scratch in other areas.For the regular person, a VPN is an accessible and more user-friendly tool for the toolbox to protect privacy. Tor is extremely limiting and slow, and while it does have its uses, it's not for the average person.

9528	 ZaphodBeebblebrox	 Some people were claiming that Privacy Badger users could be tracked by which domains they do and do not block because privacy badger generates that based on what domains it can see. To me, it sounds overly paranoid and impractical, but who knows?	
9529	 NiPinga	 True, and just because it may be  impossible to fix it all just like that does not mean that it is a bad idea to try. I believe we should do everything we can. Partly because it helps a bit, partly because someone else might get inspired and awareness grows... and partly because we can never be sure what the results of our actions will be, but chances are it might help! But if you actually NEED privacy, then the assumption you can get it by switching to another device may be dangerous...

9532	 millwrightastronomer	 Piwik isn't spyware, but why the hell is a *browser* bundling it?!?!	
9533	 krathalan	 Second vote for Solus. IMO it's the most polished distribution out of the box, great driver support, and most software is in their repositories. But no one can tell you which distro is the best for you, you really have to try each one and decide for yourself. 	
9534	 SODYOUTHEN	 It's not spyware! Spyware by definition is, you know, sneaky. It spies. This is out, publicly announced and documented. You might not like it, and you're allowed not to, but calling it spyware is idiotic.	
9535	 smokeydaBandito	 No... Not the same as google.Google didn't start with the TOS POS that Facebook did. They were molded into what they've become, and they've done so with much less publicity than Facebook.	
9536	 PrincipalVariation	 Did you by any chance run a Tor exit node in the same timeframe ?	
9537	 ThelemaWalmart	 I see your point. I just tried one site and it doesn't seem to work. Oh well. Maybe I'll try getting a SIM starter from a country that doesn't require a signed registration.	
9538	 FFakery	 you are missing the point, fsf endorsed only Pure os not librem hardware, so ask the question you tried to ask me, yourself first.I did not know they are making such progress that is a fact.So they are now shipping corebooted librems? and have plans to even libreboot them? what about the hardware limitations for librebooting?	
9539	 FFakery	 From the talk I had with them back then, it seems that they can decrypt it since they can get into account.Lol this was stupid misstype, I mean when you delete account, they keep it 20days.	
9540	 cultshrapnel	 But people who use Vivaldi will even be bothered by this at all? I mean, if you're using proprietary software when there are more than valid open-source alternatives, I can only assume you don't mind this type of stuff in any way.	
9541	 FFakery	 I did not know that they are making such a progress, so it seems they are now corebooting their hw, and also want to libreboot it, how do they want to manage to libreboot it? I mean how will they overcome the hw limitations which comes with libreboot?If they will do everything you say then its surely worth the money.Sharing information great! I was always thinking that information should be free. The heads should be awesome os for such a device, so they will abondon their pure os? or integrate it somehow within heads. Thank you very much for your explanation I highly appreciate itP.S one thing still scratches my mind, you said that : While modern Intel CPUs require binary blobs to boot, these non-Free components are included in the measurements and are at least guaranteed to be unchangingThats why Im wondering how they want to overcome this and libreboot it.Little remark from heads siteThe current release is 0.2.1 and is one of the first that is close to usable for other usersIts still underdevelopment, it seems only x230 and coreboot is supported? 	
9542	 TestyTestis	 Does this happen when you *deactivate* your account, or do you actually go through the *delete* request, where your profile stays deactivated for 2 weeks, *then* gets "deleted"?I ask because I recently put in an actual delete (not deactivate) request.

9545	 The_BlackRabbit	 Ideally, just use LineageOS without any Google Services. Even better, don't use a smartphone at all. Practically, for most users, using LineageOS with microG is far better than stock ROM. You are not giving up in usability but improving a lot in privacy. I think you're right in your point as microG still use Google, but for the majority, I consider LOS+microG a very good option to gain privacy.

9549	 Skipper_Blue	 Lmao, the data exists only on my server, not a third party. If user data were to be stolen it would be because my own server got hacked. 	
9550	 Booteille	 oh. didn't heard about that. My bad.	
9551	 DanTheMan74	 Your points make sense, but I feel you're replying to the wrong person.On this topic I've made three comments (this being my fourth) both in this thread and also in the other one that was posted in the r/vivaldibrowser subreddit. They've all been entirely factual comments to specific statements and contained no personal leanings towards one side or the other.In this case, I was merely trying to get the point across, that there's a difference between blocking piwik in websites and in the browser core itself. The former can of course be easily blocked with any decent content blocker, whereas the latter either needs a system-wide solution or outside help such as with a proxy.The limitation/breakage I alluded to is this: what happens when you null route the update.vivaldi.com domain? Will the automatic update check break and/or the download of incremental updates? Are any other services used on the domain that are not immediately obvious?I personally have no issue with providing some basic and mostly anonymous usage data like this. I don't disable all data collection in my Firefox browser either (but I do not allow the unapproved installation of Shield experiments/extensions, as that goes a step too far). But I can well understand people who think differently and for that reason I believe a company should provide an opt-out for their data collection methods.	
9552	 awe300	 Ah yes. Let me write something into the policy you know almost no one reads, so I can do whatever I want. It's totally okay then!"	
9553	 trai_dep	 Besides being non-FLOSS, it reads *way* too much like advertising copy. Your brand new account doesn't help matters on this. We appreciate the work that went into your review, but I'm going to have to remove this post for these reasons. But with no prejudice to you, OP. Please continue posting here on different topics and enjoy r/Privacy!	
9554	 Skipper_Blue	 could you give me your own definition of spyware, and then explain to me exactly what code you *think* is being run on the local computer and what private user data you *think* is being stolen?	
9555	 trai_dep	 Added "Misleading" tag. Analytics software ≠ "spyware". And as far as these things go – and these have legitimate purposes – Piwik is very well behaved with none of the 3rd party, ad-networking-added extras that Adobe or Google's versions of this have.Read thru u/NAN001's [excellent comment for more information](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7tjgpy/vivaldi_caught_incorporating_spyware_connectivity/dtd5or7/). Hat's off to u/Aproposnix &amp; u/Akunbaru's responses as well, but NAN001's had a better definition of what Piwik is and does. :)	
9556	 nothingduploading	 they backfill results from other serps, so its probably just the feed they are getting changing. Don't think that means they are tracking you.	
9557	 Skipper_Blue	 you do realize that the root of spyware is software, right? when did piwik start installing and running its self locally? 	
9558	 torpcoms	 I think I found it, it does look like it's a random number.	
9559	 peacewalker64	 !free != proprietary. It is source available, not free/libre software. I don't want being able to update my phone reliant on the dev saying I can. He has pulled updates before. I know this is /r/privacy, but we need to push free software so we can remain in control of our software. I will refuse to use or recommend Copperhead until it gets a free license. Plenty of people have made money with free software. Copperhead can too.	
9560	 australian_user	 The DuckDuckGo CEO is currently doing an AMA. Why don’t you post there and ask? :)https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7tnnv9/its_data_privacy_day_2018_im_the_founder_ceo_of	
9561	 TheOnlyDinglyDo	 https://github.com/duckduckgo The thing is open source so if you are that worried you can probably find the code belonging to the engine somewhere in their profile. (EDIT: IT IS NOT OPEN SOURCE)	
9562	 torpcoms	 The browser isn't bundling it, the browser itself is reporting back to the Piwik server.	
9563	 TestyTestis	 One thing I frequently notice is absent from advice threads like these is the recommendation of a custom hosts file. It's an extra safeguard, and the beauty of it is, you don't have to rely on 3rd-party extensions that can break or be doing nefarious things without your knowledge. Both Windows and *NIX-based systems have this hosts file, but by default it is (nearly) empty. This is the one I use: http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/hosts.htmThe format is OS-agnostic, so you can use the same one for whatever you run. I also add a bunch of entries for LinkedIn and (all?) the domains/sub-domains Facebook owns. If I ever need to connect to FB or LI, I do so through a virtual machine.	
9564	 torpcoms	 Not really, the user said something along the lines of "stupid goyim" about people using Ancestry. Don't think it was a rule 7 violation though. 	
9565	 cultshrapnel	 I'm wary of DDG, even though I use it until some proof comes to surface. But still I have to agree with this, what's described by OP is most likely one of the third parties feeding it results interpreting DDG's call itself as an user.

9568	 Skipper_Blue	 &gt; Until they sell, trade or get that data hacked and stolen from them.i think it would be natural to assume that by "they" you are referring to piwik. had you been referring to the only person able to sell userdata you would have referred to literally the only person who has access to the data (me), you would have used the pronoun "you" instead. piwik is not able to sell data about my users. they dont have any data about my users. they dont have any userdata collected on any self hosted instance of piwik. they are fully incapable of selling data they do not have. were piwik (the company) to be breached, the attacker would not be able to access user data from any self hosted instance of piwik because once again, the company does not have access to that data. once again, the only way for that data to get out would be for an attacker to go after MY specific server, and then they would get meager data on like 5 websites. they would not get access to any other self hosted piwik instance. 	
9569	 trai_dep	 True, to his credit, he didn't do (((this stupid thing))). Nonetheless… 	
9570	 MIGsalund	 I am very aware. I have permanently deleted twice. Everything comes back each time. There is no actual delete function on Facebook servers.	
9571	 nutpantz	 I dont use a vpn so I can't test that.But if it's hard coded to use Google dns I'm sure it would try, unless there is a way to change it.	
9572	 gnujedi	 You're completely free to run your own build sever with updates if you want. Their server architecture was overrun with people flashing Nexus devices. They didn't have the income or resources to support commercial users who didn't arrange it with them first. This is common sense. If you want it to change in the future, buy a Pixel or Pixel2 when they are available and support them on Patreon. It's dishonest to boycott CoppeheadOS. They are the only serious security and privacy centric mobile devs right now. Sure, FSF compliant stuff is what we should strive for but a CC license isn't the enemy; the enemy is proprietary code, code that prohibits forking, or large businesses who use invasion of privacy to make their money. CopperheadOS is none of those. If all of r/privacy pitched in (with money and code help), I bet this wouldn't even be an issue. You can always query u/strncat about issues you may have, or submit an issue on the CopperheadOS issue tracker.	
9573	 ilmbt	 🤦🏻‍♂️	
9574	 my-fav-show-canceled	 To minimize wifi tracking you must turn wifi off on your devices when you're not using it.  It's a pain in the ass because we like our phones to connect to trusted networks automatically (e.g. when we get home) so we don't hit data caps and other such nonsense from cell providers.Basically what happens is your phone will periodically transmit a "who's there?" message.  This happens automatically even if you don't actually connect to a network.  In this message is your phone's MAC address which is a statistically unique identifier.  Various products exist that will track when and where they see a particular MAC address.Using multiple radios it's not too hard for Walmart (for example) to figure out how much time you spent looking through the DVD bin.  Do you normally shop with your signifcan't other?  It's not hard to discover which MAC address are often in the store together.Huh, I see this MAC address every time this credit card makes a swipe... and now we have everything.  That's the problem with collecting infinite amounts of "anonymized" data.  You match it up with one other less anonymous data point and the whole thing comes down.Here's an article that describes some of the magic: https://www.crc.id.au/tracking-people-via-wifi-even-when-not-connected/

9576	 strncat	 Since Oreo, there's also a toggle in AOSP to block all traffic not routed via the configured always-on VPN so if it crashes or hasn't started yet there won't be leaks with that enabled. The connections will just fail instead.It never made sense to expose the entire application layer as attack surface for gaining root access to implement features like that. Features should always be properly implemented via the principle of least privilege, exposing the needed API to apps and gated by the appropriate permission checks / UX if necessary. CopperheadOS doesn't expose root access to apps and never will since the goal is substantial hardening to improve privacy and security. It does have `su` for `adb shell` in `userdebug` builds just like AOSP for development, etc. but not for apps.	
9577	 Y783ZO22MDBQ9S2	 Tor + Searx is the safest thing right now. Searx masks your IP, but you should assume a bad Searx instance might log your IP.	
9578	 peacewalker64	 &gt; It's dishonest to boycott CoppeheadOS.I will only use free software. I don't want to be told how I can use software. Copperhead doesn't follow the four freedoms of software. The license means I can't even fork it and support new devices to sell. It's prohibiting someone else providing CopperheadOS help unless /u/strncat gets all the revenue. Other devs can't do it for free either.	
9579	 nutpantz	 Building the Rom yourself still uses Google's code in Android source code..Like the dns address, location service and others.Micro g might make a more Google free Google services, but I'm worried about Google's code in the Android source code for the things I listed.	
9580	 AnonymousAurele	 That’s interesting.  Can you explain how the browser and that software work together in relation to the tracker?  What are the pro’s and cons from both perspectives of user and browser metrics (for a company to intelligently understand metrics unrelated to user tracking)?	
9581	 Y783ZO22MDBQ9S2	 +1r/ZeroNet is the CDN people should be using. Not CrimeFlare.	
9582	 SCphotog	 ...Google doing this to everyone all the time, no one blinks an eye. If you have an Android device, and it's on, even if GPS is off, it's still tracking location via triangulation from cell phone towers... and they've been "caught" doing it... on one blinks and eye, but the reality is, that MOST people just allow it, thinking there won't be any negative implications for allowing Google to have this kind of data. Did I mention that Google now gives more money to the US gov, through lobbying than any other corporation?	
9583	 TestyTestis	 Wow, that is wild. I mean, I always assumed they keep all the data and your profile just becomes entirely invisible to the public. But to have it just pop back up like that.....I wonder if that was intentional, or due to a bug.	
9584	 gnujedi	 You've made a false dichotomy. The software supports freedom more than most Libre software does by extending user privacy and security. It doesn't fit Stallman et. al's cookie cutter idea of software freedom, but it indeed does good in the world. I love GNU, the four freedoms, and copyleft politics (all my work goes under a CC0 public domain license), but that doesn't mean that I'm blind to the generosity of people like u/strncat and the endless work they put in to further human freedom and flourishing. "A mind is like a parachute. It doesn't work if it is not open." -Thomas Robert Dewar, repeated by Frank Zappa	
9585	 peacewalker64	 &gt; The software supports freedom more than most Libre software does by extending user privacy and security.By restricting how I can fork it. There's plenty of FOSS that can promote privacy and security. Not willing to make a compromise != not having an open mind. Way to use an ad hominem fallacy. If he was really about total freedom, he'd release his power over CopperheadOS. Right now, freedom with Copperhead goes as far as strncat will let you have.	
9586	 strncat	 &gt; I will only use free software.So stick to using Free Software. That's up to you. You don't have to use CopperheadOS.&gt; I don't want to be told how I can use software.Free Software licenses often tell you how you can use the software too. Our GPL2 / GPL3 licensed code prevents usage in many scenarios. For a simple example, GPL2-only code like our kernel code can't be mixed with GPL3 code. GPL2 / GPL3 have a long list of rules and restrictions. If you don't want to be told how to use software, you need to stick to permissive licenses and avoid the GPL. CopperheadOS switched from permissive licensing -&gt; GPL3 before the later license switch because it ruled out a small subset of the scenarios that the code was being used without contributing back.The upstream projects for CopperheadOS are all strongly against GPL3 and most are anti-GPL in general. OpenBSD considers GPL non-free. None of them (AOSP, Clang/LLVM, Linux, OpenBSD, etc.) could/would accept GPL3 code and it's only Linux / a shrinking tiny subset of AOSP other than Linux that's GPL2 (Linux is GPL2 *only*, not *or later*).&gt; The license means I can't even fork it and support new devices to sell. It's prohibiting someone else providing CopperheadOS help unless /u/strncat gets all the revenue. Other devs can't do it for free either.Commercial licensing is available and it certainly doesn't work by giving all the revenue to Copperhead... so that's not at all true. Copperhead is a company. I own half of it with my business partner. It's a bit weird to specifically ping me to refer to the company. There are multiple employees earning a living from the money the company brings in, not just us 2.Our experience with Free Software is that we spent 3 years publishing it under FOSS licenses without any contributions to the code. Many businesses built upon the code and gave nothing back to the project. We've been endlessly harassed by the FOSS community with lots of lies and dishonest attacks spread about us. At most we lost ~$40/month by switching licenses since donations didn't add up to much. That doesn't move the needle when needing to fund a full-time development team.Meanwhile, we continue landing as much as we can upstream and most of the people continuing to attack us are benefiting from our code since they use projects like Linux, Clang/LLVM, AOSP, OpenBSD, etc. directly or indirectly. We haven't received any grants for writing open source code or landing it upstream.AOSP went out of the way to use permissive license even when it meant large amounts of the software stack had to be written from scratch. They did that so the downstream forks wouldn't need to be Free Software projects like AOSP. They'd definitely never use GPL3 code under any condition as the restrictions are totally incompatible with most of their downstream forks.It's unreasonable to expect everything to be given away free for any use with us being unable to earn a living or hire any developers. The new licensing model has let us hire more developers already and we'll be expanding to a substantially larger team. The upstream projects are going to benefit far more than if we'd stuck with trying to make FOSS licensing work and that licensing didn't help them since as I said earlier, they can't / won't use GPL3 code which is the license we started using about 2 years into it instead of permissive licensing.	
9587	 strncat	 &gt; At most we lost ~$40/month by switching licenses since donations didn't add up to much.That's also not accounting for the *increase* in donations caused by the license change. There's a big spike when we changed the license. Still, donations don't add up to enough to fund even a part-time developer for more than a couple days a month. Revenue needs to come from a real business model based around licensing out code to companies and selling phones. Neither works when any company can take all the code, invest all their money in marketing / sales and compete with the company doing all the work for them without needing to spend any money on development.We can upstream code safely because then everyone ends up with it, not just competitors, and the upstream projects *only want a small subset of the changes* anyway. Often need to do a fair bit of work convincing them to take changes and that can be way more time consuming than actually implementing the features. The downstream code making the more aggressive changes (significant performance / memory costs, user-facing security features, etc.) is what we can earn a living from.	
9588	 strncat	 I'm not working 60-80 hours a week for 8k/year and we'd need to lay off the developers we've hired and cancel plans to substantially expand. There can be no CopperheadOS without licensing that provides a viable business model.Anyone could have forked the GPL3-licensed 6.x era code if they were interested in doing the work. That code wasn't somehow retroactively relicensed. No one did that for obvious reasons. Paying a few developers 80k to 200k/year to develop it without having a way to earn any substantial revenue isn't going to happen.	
9589	 peacewalker64	 &gt; It's unreasonable to expect everything to be given away free for any use with us being unable to earn a living or hire any developers. Then charge for it and release it under something like GPL or BSD license. Red Hat does this. Restrict your update server to licensed devices but let us do whatever with the code.I specifically pinged you because the other person did.

9591	 Chriz555	 Useful to find popular training spots, unknown to me!	
9592	 aFoxWhoIsNice	 Yes. That's the one I believe. 	
9593	 strncat	 &gt; Then charge for it and release it under something like GPL or BSD license.It didn't work for us after trying for several years and it's not going to magically work with another attempt. If we allow commercial usage for free, that's a decision to end the project because most of our revenue will come to an end. We'll need to lay off the developers we're hired and then stop because we can no longer work without earning income after spending several years earning far less than a sustainable income.&gt; Red Hat does this.That doesn't mean it works for a substantially different kind of project and niche.&gt; Restrict your update server to licensed devices but let us do whatever with the code.That doesn't accomplish much. Other companies can trivially make their own update servers without any development work and can then spend all their money on marketing and sales. That's already what happened before.We're interested in having a viable business model, supporting ourselves and expanding our development team substantially to take on the gargantuan tasks ahead. I'm not sure where giving everything away for free and destroying all of the work we've done towards licensing out the code and building business relationships fits into that.If you think it's as easy as you make it out to be, why aren't you doing it already?I have no idea how even after going to back to having a single developer (which is ridiculous for the scale of the project) we'd be able to earn enough money to earn something comparable to minimum wage if we didn't have commercial licensing as a way of getting revenue.	
9594	 peacewalker64	 That's all your decision. I don't like how everyone (not necessarily you) tries to defend how Copperhead is free (as in freedom, libre) when it's clearly not. It's your choice, but as a result, I'll never recommend it. That's all.

9596	 strncat	 It allows modification and redistribution, so it's not simply "source available". OpenBSD considers GPL non-free and the FSF considers our chosen Creative Commons license non-free, but it's a misrepresentation to say that the source is simply available for viewing.Copperhead has yet to ever receive any funding for writing free software or any serious offers of funding. The option to fund the release of components under more permissive license is there as it was from the start.Our upstreaming efforts have also always been without funding and have continued to the same extent after adopting the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International license.We still release a large amount of free software and land a lot of changes upstream, and yet we only get attacked by the FOSS community with little to no support for that ongoing work.There was little to no interest in making or funding a public, GPL2 alternative to PaX and grsecurity either after they became private (partly due to lack of community support). It's always just expected that someone else does all the work for free and somehow gets by without earning income for full time work.	
9597	 strncat	 That's your choice, but it would be nice if you were honest about it and stuck to factual arguments. I don't see anyone calling it 'libre'.	
9598	 gnujedi	 To clarify, I totally agree with you that GPL3 and Libre licensed software is the best. I just disagree that boycotting Copperheados is a wise thing to do. In fact, supporting it—like the twitter post mentioned—should allow them to Libre license the code in the future. Plus, **they actively try to upstream their code!** This means that the average Android or AOSP user might benefit from the privacy and security work they do. If you want to get Copperheados Libre licensed, start committing code and helping them out.	
9599	 strncat	 I spent 5 years of my life contributing to open source projects full time, without being paid, and then 2 years unsuccessfully trying to do it as a full time job. I'm not sure what I got out of any of that beyond a community of people following me around harassing me, sending me death threats and feeling entitled to having all of my work for free forever. The first year I earned anything close to a reasonable salary was last year, thanks to not working on Free Software anymore but instead still publishing the source code and requiring that others using it commercially pay a licensing fee / share the revenue made from earning money based on our work.Instead of thanking us for the Free Software that we continue to publish and the changes we upstream into projects that you probably use, you're here attacking me and making dishonest arguments / claims. That's my experience with the FOSS community as a whole. It's just endless attacks, dishonesty, misrepresentations, death threats, and a shocking level of entitlement. Why should I go out of my way, even to the point that I destroy my livelihood, to give something to that community? I've yet to hear an explanation of *why* we should relicense everything for you. It won't make any better and it just cuts off any hope of earning reasonable income from it + continuing it.

9603	 peacewalker64	 I didn't mean to attack you. I'm sorry if that's how it came across. I haven't been informed of anything you push upstream. All talk seems to be about CopperheadOS directly. I appreciate what you do as a project. I do disagree with the license though. The only reason I care so much is the fact that CopperheadOS is the only security-focused ROM. I want you to succeed, but I want it to be with libre software. I'm sorry I got a little hot-headed. Can you forgive me? In the end, it's your project and you can do what you wish with it. Please don't take this as me trying to force you.My goal is to have software help everyone, and from my point of view, that means GPL, BSD, or something similar. I release all of my software as GPL because I want to help people. I'm more concerned with what my users get out of it than what I do.	
9604	 strncat	 A subset of what has been pushed upstream is listed in https://copperhead.co/android/docs/technical_overview. There's a bunch of stuff marked as upstreamed and it's out-of-date from the current state of things where more landed. The Linux kernel code landed upstream along with code review and pushing ideas there aren't listed there at all. Also not listed there are the dozen reported vulnerabilities found primarily by features we implemented that caught them.Our downstream kernel changes and some of our other code is also still GPL2 since that's how GPL2 works.	
9605	 australian_user	 I might throw this up straight away. For a phone to be private and trustworthy the OS needs to be open-source. It also depends what you need. I have a ‘dumb phone’ that has data disabled both on the service and on the actual handset. It can only do calls and sms. My location can still be triangulated if it’s turned on.

9607	 strncat	 &gt; My goal is to have software help everyone, and from my point of view, that means GPL, BSD, or something similar. I release all of my software as GPL because I want to help people. I'm more concerned with what my users get out of it than what I do.This is my full-time job, and will be the full-time job for a team of other developers. It's not a hobby at all. Most of the work isn't fun. It's dreadful spending weeks debugging memory corruption bugs and doing tons of backporting, release engineering and testing rather than actual development. In fact, I really don't enjoy most of the work I end up needing to do as I don't actually get to spend much time doing interested security research. Making a quality product suitable for end users is a lot of work and takes a lot of resources. I already spent years working on FOSS for free and I can't do that anymore. I need an actual job, and I'm perfectly happy doing it working on improving privacy / security while keeping our downstream changes requiring payment for commercial use. I didn't like how it was being used as permissively licensed code anyway, there's more to wanting to avoid that than money. I don't do all this work so people can sell it at scale to organized criminal networks in Europe to replace PGP Blackberries.

9617	 strncat	 Well, it really does feel that way. Companies that were using our stuff are listed here:https://www.thedailybeast.com/meet-danny-the-guy-selling-encrypted-phones-to-organized-crimeIt's not like these people are using our sources and builds to do good for the world. They make us look really bad and they would lose us any chance of appealing to enterprise / governments if we kept building software for them.I wouldn't be surprised if the *majority* of the users using our official Nexus 5X / 6P builds were on devices illegally sold by these companies in violation of our non-commercial usage license.  We can't even sell official Pixel builds because they are going to buy one and misuse it, forcing us to only sell phones with the official builds. It's bullshit.Most of these companies aren't capable of easily building from source but some are, and were doing that, since they wanted to rebrand the devices and incorporate sketchy 'secure' app suites they licensed. Luckily, the companies competent enough to build their own OS based on it are unlikely to violate licenses since they have a lot more to lose.Ignoring all the stuff about PGP Blackberry vendors, the reality we found is that almost no company is going to pay for anything from us if we make everything available for free. Even if they are willing to pay, we have no negotiating power since they are 100% aware they can use it all for free and pay other developers / companies. There was no way to earn money from the actual OS development work only contract work that was barely even tied to the OS at all and took away too much time from developing it to continue.Look at F-Droid, the Guardian Project, etc. They spend so much time doing consulting and finding other ways to support themselves that their actual passion projects suffer from being neglected. CopperheadOS can't just languish without proper maintenance, porting to new Android versions, etc. There's no point if it doesn't preserve all the mainline AOSP privacy / security and then build substantially upon that. It always needs to be doing new research, implementing new features, etc. and pushing the status quo forward. Those features all need to be properly tested, maintained and endlessly ported to new versions.	
9618	 strncat	 If someone else wrote code for AOSP or CopperheadOS, that code is permissively licensed (or GPL2 for the kernel, but so is all of ours) anyway. It's code written by Copperhead without funding to make it FOSS that's licensed for non-commercial usage for the public release.	
9619	 strncat	 The base sources used for Google Contacts, Google Dialer, Calculator, Clock, Pixel Launcher, etc. are open source in AOSP so there are actively developed AOSP versions of those apps just without Google service integration. They abandoned the AOSP Email, Calendar, Search and Music apps but not those others which still serve as the basis for their own apps.Most operating systems building on AOSP include variants of the actively developed AOSP apps.

Unless I am logging in, it should be as though I am clearing cookies between every page/img/stylesheet request.If you as a webdeveloper want to track me, either look at the log files my requests generate anyway, or ask me. In an ideal world, Youtube (for example) would ask, or at least tell you, when it is tracking you between webpages to give "recommended" videos.The cookie warning tried to do something like this, but no one ever explained what they were doing with which cookies and instead simply made generic (and therefore useless) "we use cookies" warnings.

By that same rationale the FSF is shady because there's proprietary software. Why is the FSF being so shady? Why haven't they offered a superior free software alternative for every piece of software?

Purism, the company behind it, already has successfuly issued Librem 13 and Librem 15 (13" and 15" laptops), featuring hardware kill switches for the radio (wi-fi &amp; bluetooth) and camera &amp; microphone.I am a former user of iPhone 6, until it was slowed down to an unacceptable point and I decided to gid out my Nexus 5. Apple seems to care about users privacy, and seems to do as much as it can, but the NSA has been known for targeting Apple devices and server.	
9695	 caepri43	 No it's not better, it's a scam premined with hight Dev fee. And privacy is a option. Plus,no one use Zcash on drug market but monero. Ask yourself why ...	
9696	 ablackminute	 Jesus. What are they thinking?	
9697	 LPlantarum	 No you are WRONG! IT IS MORE PRIVATE THAN MONERO, it is not that fast yet but it is being improved more and more all the time. Mark my words it will rise above Monero. Plus zcash has been on other dark markets too.	
9698	 smurfhunter99	 They're both private, as most Cryptos are (they only record wallet addresses). Chill out. Even if one is more private than the other, they both so different things better

9706	 JeffersonsSpirit	 &gt; Mozilla’s positioned this as not just a way to see if it can make some cash but its own contribution towards making web ads better.... I highly doubt this.&gt; “We believe the current model of web advertising is broken because it doesn’t respect user privacy, isn’t transparent, lacks control, all the while trending towards click-bait and low-quality content,” the outfit wrote. “We need to conduct experiments like this in order to help create change.”The first point is fair enough. My question is what constitutes "quality content" and *who* determines when something is quality content? If we give a person or entity the power to curate information, that person or entity inevitably becomes corrupt; absent some democratic process that balances "elite" and "common" interests, a tyranny of the minority or of the majority always takes hold.This is just IMO, but I dont buy their bullshit. This sounds straight out of a spokesman's mouth, and they are masters of spin- not ideology. It is important I think to consider that Mozilla is in a very difficult position. They have poor market share with Firefox, and their chief competitor is one of the most powerful tech companies in the world with a virtually limitless supply of money. This competitor is also their only meaningful form of income. Donations don't cover their expenses. They are trying any possible way to generate some kind of revenue stream (IMO), and thats where these sort of initiatives come from. I would expect more in the future.It's tempting to say "boycott Firefox!" or "to Chromium I go!" or "use waterfox!" but these are not solutions either. Waterfox relies on Firefox development. Boycotting Firefox or using Chromium results in a browser monoculture with *Google at the helm.* Chromium has had its own fuckups i.e. the microphone crap. There's the analytics tracking with Vivaldi recently. This spying crap is everywhere and in almost every product. At least with something FOSS like Firefox, these monsters cannot be hidden in darkness. To be fair, Chromium is FOSS, but again it supports a browser monoculture. I really think Mozilla should be partnering with privacy-minded services. Think working with Protonmail for new services, duckduckgo, etc. Generate revenue streams with entities that deserve respect and that respect users- this will help them to avoid alienating their hardcore base, and will attract those seeking refuge from the Tower of Google.As a final note, its worth noting that this requires running Firefox Beta (for now) *and* having Pocket enabled. One of the first things you should probably do is disable Pocket anyways, so there's that. More missteps from Mozilla, but we can't lose the faith yet- we absolutely need a competitor of Mozilla's stature to offer even a small check to Google's web belligerence...

9713	 SimonWoodburyForget	 Being open source means you can look at the source code and know what the advertisement is doing. That's all it "means". Some parts of Reddit are open source, it doesn't mean they'll stop publishing advertisements. Servers need to be fed electricity and developers need to be fed caffeine. The whole operation is much larger then it seems from the outside.To keep them selves in the market, they need to keep developing new technologies, not only in relation to the browser.	
9714	 PM_ME_REDHAIR	 At this point why not chromium?	
9715	 odencon	 By showing up ads, they'll get less funding from donations and people'll will start looking for alternatives. 	
9716	 JDGumby	 &gt; Being open source means you can look at the source code and know what the advertisement is doing. That's all it "means". The advertisements themselves aren't open source.  The browser is, but the ads will still spew out their obfuscated load of javascript at you.	
9717	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
9718	 -LOLOCAUST-	 They're switching from donations to ad revenue. this is the death of Firefox. Brave, or some other open source alternative, will become the go to for non-chrome users over the next couple of years.	
9719	 PM_ME_UR_PHD_THESES	 Aaaand back to Chrome I go.	
9720	 Loumier	 Is this the app name?	
9721	 Ansem_T	 It is indeed. I also use it, and I'm pretty happy with it overall. Text and images work pretty well, and it's easy to navigate to new subreddits, subscribed subreddits, or custom multireddits.	
9722	 Loumier	 I'm using the official. Is it better than the official app?	
9723	 tficharmers	 It's a great talk from Andreas and I am also happy cryptocurrencies are being developed to keep individuals financial transactions private.However, I should point out that because Zcash's transactions are either optionally private or transparent, blockchain analysis has been done to reveal that passing between private and transparent addresses can be traceable in some circumstances. See [zcashlink.com](http://zcashlink.com)In contrast, all of Monero's transactions are opaque. By default. You can't turn this off, although you can optionally allow a Monero address to be audited by giving certain keys to an auditor.Because Zcash transactions can be traced (like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Nem, Verge, etc), their outputs can be tainted/blacklisted, if it has been deemed by an authority to have been involved in a transaction(s) they don't approve. **By making all Monero transactions opaque/private, this means it is fungible**. Therefore, you can be sure that all Monero outputs are worth the same. This is a required feature of money, because when you spend and receive it, it is nice to be assured that the value is 1 = 1. Only Monero (and potentially some recent forked coins from Monero) can claim to be private and untraceable, because **ALL transactions have to be opaque/private**.[Here is another article about Monero's privacy](https://www.monero.how/how-does-monero-privacy-work)	
9724	 torku	 What do you mean by safari not being safe?	
9725	 seaninthecity	 Do you recommend going to brave now versus later ? Help me out. 	
9726	 -LOLOCAUST-	 I dunno. I've always used FF as my privacy browser, but since they broke a ton of add-ons with quantum and all the recent corporate whoring of Mozilla, I too am looking for a permanent alternative... Maybe time to just go with tor browser?	
9727	 ondondil	 You'll see some promoted articles in pocket if you haven't disabled pocket on your newtab page already (which is trivial to do). There is no `obfuscated load of javascript`. If you criticize something, at least make some kind of effort and read something about an actual implementation instead of clickbait blogspam titles.	
9728	 seaninthecity	 I definitely can’t use Tor full time for many reasons - also - my view is that it’s better to direct some traffic through a normal but privacy oriented browser so not all outgoing traffic is on tor, just feels dodgy. I’ll try brave. 	
9729	 -LOLOCAUST-	 Yeah. I've avoided tor due to becoming more of a surveillance state target and essentially reducing your privacy. Brave seems good so far; I'm hoping it develops a rich ecosystem of extensions, like FF had until recently.	
9730	 EmojiProphet	 I'm going to go on ahead and call this sensationalist. Primarily because by design the government literally has "intimate and personal data" on everyone from birth. And in fact the most important piece of info we have, SSNs, is literally government issued.  Also because federal ID is already a thing; passports and military ID."carry a government-approved ID containing 'biometric features.'” This sounds exactly like the REAL ID act (or whatever it was called) that wants each state to update THEIR ID's to contain said biometric data. Which I would be able to confirm if the "source" wasn't another biased website's article.	
9731	 DEYoungRepublicans	 Real ID is still enforced, this would be an additional database, most likely tied into e-verify. This exact idea was tried in 2010 and shutdown by the ACLU and other civil liberties groups.https://www.nyclu.org/en/publications/fact-sheet-mandatory-biometric-worker-identification-cards-briefer-2010	
9732	 thebardingreen	 They survived for so long without turning to the dark side.  Now that they have, there's an opportunity for someone to fork their code, commit to non-commercial, true privacy and get some donations.

9734	 EnglishClientele	 I'll second the vote for Sync.  I've also played around with Boost, which I quite like, as well.	
9735	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt; I've heard terms like plausible deniability and know of making a fake volume in Vera but there's got to be more to this. What the heck should someone do if someone is willing to torture you for your data?No, there's really not much more to this. Either you convince your adversary that your outer volume password is your only password (which will be difficult given a technically-sophisticated, or just a competent or mistrustful adversary), you withstand torture (there are workshops available for at-risk journalists on withstanding enhanced interrogation techniques, but they're available in very limited parts of the world and ultimately run into individual threshold barriers), or you give up your hidden volume password (at which point there is still no guarantee your well-being will not continue to be in jeopardy). Not much more to do here if your threat model includes someone using force, so not sure what you're asking. If the data is more important than your well-being, the ultimate last step is to make sure that you don't know the password yourself, by uploading an encrypted copy of the archive to a trusted foreign source, instructing them to re-encrypt it using a new key, and then securely deleting your copy of the data. Threat of physical harm is precisely why journalists (and their sources) need to remain anonymous. If you're in a situation where threat of physical harm is a real, significant threat, then ultimately you have already lost and need to plan for failure (see above about not being able to give the adversary the password).

9742	 PM_ME_UR_PHD_THESES	 If you're running plugins to block trackers it's more or less the same.	
9743	 torpcoms	 Even more so, since GA could more easily track you between websites; if a the same User Agent/IP combo is loading the same script on multiple sites, GA could assume that its the same user.  Unless you share your logs with other web admins, a local analytics system like Piwik/Matomo limits the tracking to one site.	
9744	 seaninthecity	 What are you hoping for the most as far as extensions? As someone who only uses https always, no script and instapaper - I’m just curious. 	
9745	 skidmark-steve	 So, the descent continues. Honestly, it was bad enough when Mozilla silently installed an unknown browser extension with an obfuscated name and purpose onto millions of computers without getting permission first/An opt out option being enabled to participate in Firefox studies (that I didn't even know about) is not "getting permission".	
9746	 torpcoms	 Not replace, stop using it for stupid stuff like identification. It's meant as an account number for your social security benefits, I haven't heard any issues with that use, the problem is when you let the government and other companies use it for identification, or really anything other than paying in and out of your SS account.It's like having a frequent flier card on a goverment-owned airline act as your national ID.	
9747	 ThePenultimateOne	 You're crazy if you think that an ad blocker would stop Google's trackers in Google's browser	
9748	 ThunderousOath	 It sucks to see Firefox go this way. It's going to take a minute to find a good enough browser to replace it.	
9749	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
9750	 LPlantarum	 That's cool so if zcash makes a higher amount of transactions private in proportion to transparent than it will be super duper private in the future.	
9751	 torpcoms	 &gt; For instance, if E-Verify were instituted nationwide ***3.6 million*** Americans would be denied employment each year and ***have to visit the Social Security Administration to correct their records***.If your current records are this bad, I can kind of understand the desire to make a new system. 3.6 million records are screwed up, if the Equifax breach was ~143 million, that's 2.5% of all frequently used records.---It would be worth finding out what "biometric features" means here, is it just a photo/height/eye-color or finderprints or something more? The USA passport, [for example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometric_passport#United_States), does not include fingerprints in its biometric data.

9757	 flakysloth	 It may not be spyware, but there's nothing wrong with blocking it if you don't like it.	
9758	 [deleted]	 [removed]	
9759	 chdo	 all of this can be turned off, though, if you take a minute to adjust your settings.  you can opt out of appearing in heat maps (admittedly, they should be opt in) and set privacy zones around your house via Strava's website.  an application literally designed to track your GPS location is doing exactly what it claims to be doing -- at some point it's on users to choose either not to use the application or to learn how to make their use of it private.	
9760	 Idas_Hund	 If this was an opt-in feature, I would opt-in to support them. But having ads forced upon you is not cool.	
9761	 walterbanana	 I like Redreader	
9762	 SODYOUTHEN	 It's kind of shitty, as you're violating the Terms of Service. However, that's debatable and is a minor point. What's not OK is making provably false statements, and spreading FUD and negative accusations without valid cause. 	
9763	 attrigh	 +1 The title should probably read: personnel inadvertently upload location of military base to exercise-tracking app.	
9764	 Ansem_T	 That I don't know. I've never used the Official App, as I heard it was poorly implemented and lacking features. However, this may have changed since launch.	
9765	 paleseed	 I'm more intrigued at how Mozilla has been a functioning company for the past dozen years or so.  How did they get money to pay for things?	
9766	 flakysloth	 Our opinions differ on the shittiness of violating terms of service, but I think we can agree on your second point, at least. :)	
9767	 tficharmers	 Well... no. There will always be the problem of [Zcash's trusted setup](https://blog.okturtles.com/2016/03/the-zcash-catch/).I guess it could be "more private" than it is now... potentially. They would have to make all the transactions opaque by default. But because of the trusted setup and not being able to audit the Zcash supply, someone could be printing Zcash out of thin air thereby devaluing any Zcash you hold. We just don't know. That's something I'm not comfortable with.[edit]I forgot to add [Zooko's outrageous tweet](https://twitter.com/zooko/status/863202798883577856). Yeah... not comfortable with the CEO making contradictory statements like that.

9776	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
9777	 ilzxbuny	 You can still use the Tor browser without connecting to the Tor routing system. It's still a fork of firefox that'll let you browse the internet just fine. It just helps tell you whether or not you're connected to the Tor system.	
9778	 FFakery	 I never said their product is perfect yet, but at least they should not represent it as one and selling it as one. I bet it was not that long time ago before they started using coreboot, so If I would be early bird I would be madly pissed of for the same reason as other people was on the forums, because they are pretending they are selling something that is not yet anywhere nearly done. I never said that fsf is shady, but only librem hardware, about the proprietary soft, do you mean pure os? Thats not an issue, you can reinstal other os like trisquel or whatever you want iso is still there  . I know they are trying and they do need to raise money firstly for the futher progress. I never said anything bad about pure os. just the hardware. They should offer for their early costumer an option (for the price of shipping) to implement the features that they are developing, at least corebooting the devices which was bought before that. that would be absolutely right thing to do. I know it is a hard problem to solve and some doubters wont believe that they will accomplish the goals of librebooting them, because of intel. But I believe they can do it with right attitude. I bet you would be pissed  of If you read about some amazing product without the long thinking you would buy it and then find out, ah the promised features are not there, Its not done yet, nevermind, you wait, and then you find out the support is not there and you must buy hw and learn how to do it by yourself. Its this marketing attitude, that makes people mad, but I believe that purism can be much more better company if they start honoring their early costumers.   If you are part of librem team and you would suggest this to them, you can make it easier to achieve what they want to achieve.

9794	 -LOLOCAUST-	 [I prefer my browser to not install malware or alter the content I see in any way] (https://www.engadget.com/2017/12/16/firefox-mr-robot-extension/). Mozilla have lost alot of trust and I don't see them returning to what they used to be.	
9795	 shawnshine	 So you have no fears of the manufacturer writing down the seed that you order from them? Yeesh. 	
9796	 TibetanBowlHealing	 You’re probably right, but replacing Firefox with Chrome is jumping out of the frying pan into the fire. Chrome keeps you perpetually logged in and is tracking your activity constantly, especially across devices.	
9797	 FeatheryAsshole	 not if you want to install from your distro's official repo. there ARE alternatives, but chromium, qupzilla etc aren't particularly good at privacy.

9802	 Maggoats	 Whether they're alienating their core uses base or not, they want a larger browser market share and greater profit from advertisement. If they can package that in one of the most popular browsers, they could implement Basic Attention Token in Firefox in addition to the Brave browser, something I presume Brendan Eich, co-founder of Mozilla *and* Brave will most definitely enjoy.Considering Mozilla's a non-profit, however, I'm not certain where they're going with this.	
9803	 SODYOUTHEN	 I've got mixed feelings on the first myself. I dislike analytics (and ads) and block them as a matter of course. On the other hand, they're making this software for free (to users at least) and seem to be the best balance I've found so far.	
9804	 YXjs0t5Dcqq2E5Ev	 The Bitcoin blockchain is useful for many things, but privacy is not one of them. I'm seeing reports of authorities using tools like [Chainalysis](https://www.chainalysis.com/) to analyze transactions (and potentially prosecute based on overwhelming evidence).	
9805	 CognitiveDissident7	 Definitely 	
9806	 AlcoLols	 I agree it's probably more private but it's not as fast as Firefox or Chrome on my device. I believe it comes down to the engine it uses. Firefox is built on Gecko(??), while focus uses the built in engine on Android.

9810	 Antabaka	 "Ad" doesn't mean "iframe", it means its an *ad*. You'd think that when you're replying to someone who says you need to do your own research before criticizing something, you wouldn't come at it from a point of having literally no understanding.https://blog.mozilla.org/futurereleases/2018/01/24/update-on-pocket-and-firefox-integration/And if you still aren't going to read things on your own: The browser fetches the entire collection of images and links and locally determines what to show you. Then it shows a simple card (on the new tab page, within the 'recommended by pocket' tiles) with the thumbnail, snippet of text, and URL - which were all downloaded in bulk. You can disabled sponsored tiles, and even disabled the entire trending pocket link section, with a basic checkbox.No javascript, certainly no cryptomining.	
9811	 N03y3s	 What I've described here is the roadmap they have created and, thus far, they have followed it.On Libreboot's site, it is said that: "Libreboot’s main upstream provider is coreboot, which [Libreboot's devellopers] deblob."Therefore, I'm assuming that Libreboot will work on Librem devices once all proprietary firmware is replaced/removed.For the Heads+TPM part, it is, for now, just an announcement and they want to implement it later that year.My current understanding of heads is that it is a very small Linux distribution that act as a bootloader and is meant to be flashed in ROM. Therefore, a Linux distribution such as PureOS that is installed on an HDD/SDD can be booted up through Heads (to me it is a firmware), which will verify that the system hasn't been modified.As for the integration of Heads along Libreboot, I'm assuming they will try to reverse engineer the CPU firmware so that an open sourced one will be used instead. Also, they will have to port Heads firmware to their Librem devices, because, indeed, only the Lenovo x230 is properly supported.Be aware though that, to reach their goal of Librebooting their Librem devices, they still have to deblob the rest of the board. The management engine, while deactivated and neutralized, isn't removed yet because of a time limit that was implemented by Intel so that the computer shuts down after 30min if the Intel ME isn't present. Therefore, they need to leave around 100kb, which is more than 99% of the ME binary which is normally around 1.5MB.They began reverse engineering the Intel FSP not too long ago and they still need to find a solution for the vBIOS and EC.So, Libreboot isn't quite there yet, but I'm sure that, someday, they will have Libreboot's proper support.

9813	 uph	 I'm not recommending using software by Microsoft or any proprietary software. I'm asking if you think it makes sense to trust Microsoft with your OS but not with FDE. 	
9814	 Antabaka	 Google (and for a time Yahoo, but they're back to Google) pay for their slot as the default search engine. This is why they're pursuing privacy conscious and easily opt-out-able advertising like this. To reduce their reliance on Google.	
9815	 amalgam_reynolds	 Sponsored ads is exactly why I ditched ABP	
9816	 __ah	 That tweet is taken out of context. He conditions that on having to move between fiat (see next tweet) — if you go from zcash to fiat via an exchange, your privacy isn't preserved.Anyway, in case you'd like to see how Zcash supporters respond to these criticisms: https://www.zcashcommunity.com/2017/07/31/zcash-separating-fact-fiction/	
9817	 stevewatson301	 Well, it doesn't have alternatives for many Firefox/chrome privacy extensions like HTTPS everywhere, Privacy badger, Decentraleyes, and others.	
9818	 Antabaka	 Calling that add-on "malware", and claiming that it alters the content you see, is incredibly misinformed. It did **nothing** without the user manually enabling it in about:config.The problem with that extension was the fear it caused because it *looked* like malware. The backlash by Mozilla engineers was massive, I doubt something like that will ever happen again.	
9819	 Antabaka	 &gt; all the recent corporate whoring of Mozilla...What are you talking about?	
9820	 metaaxis	 NONONONONONO.JUST NO.	
9821	 ThunderousOath	 Plenty of alternatives, luckily all I really need are ghostery/disconnect, ublock origins, and https everywhere.    Edit: dunno why you lot down voted me, as I was just stating the basic features I need to switch browsers which makes it easier, unlike many who say they need some huge list of bullshit so they can't do so easily.	
9822	 ThunderousOath	 Javascript injection is the way these days. They got past that at least a year ago, at least that's when I heard about it. None of the typical plug-ins stop this. 	
9823	 FeatheryAsshole	 1. It builds on Chrome's Blink engine - even assuming qupzilla's dev (yes, singular) has the best intentions, it's hard to believe that you can make a private browser based on Chrome.2.  There aren't a lot of extensions you can install - I really doubt that it's enough to disable cookies and block ads. Also, it makes for a really shoddy user experience compared to a customized Firefox.	
9824	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
9825	 FeatheryAsshole	 you also need to set firefox's config options to sane values. take a look at this: https://gist.github.com/haasn/69e19fc2fe0e25f3cff5that's quite a lot to keep track of, especially considering that these options change over time.

9828	 Darkeyescry22	 How would you go about creating a non invasive ID system? I'm all for that, in principle, but I don't see how it can be done.Also, while the use of SSN as ID it's not officially endorsed, in practice that use is nearly ubiquitous, even by the government. This isn't a strawman, because it's very likely that the implementation of a true national ID system would eliminate the current practice.	
9829	 OneSubtractOne	 This. If your concern is privacy then chrome is a horrible idea no matter what. Chromium maybe. But not default Chrome. If your concern is a browser that doesn't claim to be all good fighting for your rights and then stabbing you in the back over and over, then at least Chrome is honest in its admitting to be a giant net to gain Google all your info. 	
9830	 thearkadia	 This is why brave (although based on chromium) will win for privacy browser. It has the most sane defaults	
9831	 stefantalpalaru	 &gt; I'm more intrigued at how Mozilla has been a functioning company for the past dozen years or so. How did they get money to pay for things?They manage. Mozilla had a revenue of $520,000,000 in 2016: https://www.ghacks.net/2017/12/02/mozillas-revenue-increased-significantly-in-2016/

9833	 Darkeyescry22	 You are and will continue to be. Unless you never touch a computer, are permanently unemployed, were born outside of a hospital, don't legally own your property, etc. you are certainly being at the very least indexed.	
9834	 stefantalpalaru	 &gt; Because that's like saying "well, the US sucks, why not move to North Korea". No, it's like observing that Firefox became nothing more than a Chromium clone and choosing the original.	
9835	 XanaduApocalypse	 Thanks for Qubreboot DodoDude700.  But I was thinking of running Qubes on a librebooted T400 from a USB drive.Is there some reason that either shouldn't or can't be done?Another question: Can your script serve as a template for the installation of other OSs (Parrot OS, Subgraph OS, etc.)?	
9836	 -LOLOCAUST-	 Yeah no... "The extension was installed on users' devices without prior permission and uploaded text, images and game clues to websites. The only permission it was for was to a program called Shield Studies, which enabled Firefox's creators to gather data for improving the browser in the future."You install shit on my computer I didn't ask for or give explicit permission for, I'm calling your shit malware.Most FF users don't want their open source browser installing corporate plugins without their explicit permission. End of story.	
9837	 ruptes	 Well well well, what do we have here? Should I just send a sperm sample too? 	
9838	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
9839	 Antabaka	 Reading isn't that hard.  The article you linked to says it multiple times.&gt;&gt;Despite the troubling way the extension was installed, Mozilla said **it doesn't do anything to your system until you opt in**to the Alternate Reality Game#&gt;&gt;And so while the web extension/add-on that was sent out to Firefox users never collected any data, and **had to be explicitly enabled by users playing the game before it would affect any web content**, we heard from some of our users that the experience we created caused confusion.#&gt;Most FF users don't want their open source browser installing corporate plugins without their explicit permission. End of story.And yeah, that's where the backlash came in. r/Firefox was filled with Mozilla devs talking about how disappointed and angry they were with management for turning it into a shield study and pushing it out, especially during a time where almost everyone who works for Mozilla was in the middle of traveling (back home from an in-person conference).	
9840	 debridezilla	 I expect this will be an unpopular opinion, but I think this sort of experimentation is good and that Mozilla is the right company to be doing it. Ads suck, pure and simple. Websites let ads suck, because they're easy revenue. Thus users are increasingly using browser extensions to block ads. As a result, ad revenue is decreasing and advertisers are becoming increasingly desperate, sneaky, and aggressive, which is even worse for the user experience (often in ways that we can't directly observe). This is a degrading cycle with no clear solution -- no reliable revenue alternatives, even for services (like independent news media) that are universally held to be valuable. If Mozilla can figure out how to make advertising a good consumer experience, that's good for all players. Plus, as a FOSS org, they'll presumably be a better proxy for users than, say, Microsoft or Google.

9843	 tficharmers	 Thanks for the link. I'm aware of the continuation of his twitter dialogue. It is still outrageous in his claim that Zcash can be fungible **only**  when taking into account the movement of Zcash to Fiat. What happens when an unsuspecting user receives a blacklisted output on-chain? It would appear that I'm from the "techies and ideologues" group ;-)This is also a stretch of logic and language: *Fiction: Zcash is not private by default*But you can have that one if you want. However Zcash doesn't have mandatory opaque transactions which prevent newbs, mistakes and stupidity from making their private transactions stand out from their transparent ones, thus potentially linking the future recipients of their outputs.

9845	 paleseed	 Meh i tried looking it up but most who accuse Mozilla of funding antifa are sensationalist bullshit headlines like "omg firefox gave antifa $100,000" (like the reddit post that guy left), and are from obviously biased sources.RiseUp seems to help *all* who would like to stay anonymous - violent groups like antifa obviously have a need to so it's no wonder they would use their services.  *It seems they have a strong political bias after all, which sucks because I was hoping it was more in line with an unbiased privacy directive.  That they could monitor your account to enforce TOS compliance actually makes me wonder how private the service actually is.As privacy advocates I think we all have to agree that we kind of have to allow groups like these to exist as a side-effect of not having the government know where everybody is and what they're doing at all times.  privacy vs security

9867	 Fer22f	 Ah. And reddit is no longer open source.	
9868	 3WcWUFULrV85	 Honestly, occasional ads are probably better than the present system of Mozilla/Firefox funding, which seems to be to push stupid privacy/security destroying 'features'--features which just happen to be used by startups spun by senior mozilla staff/developers. They have never acted in the public interest and have way too powerful a voice at the table in setting web standards because people seem to believe, despite all evidence to the contrary, that Mozilla operates in the public interest.	
9869	 distant_worlds	 &gt; What do self-driving cars have to do with writing a search engine?Google is not taking donations for building a better web browser, then funneling the money to their ideological causes.	
9870	 DodoDude700	 Hi there, thanks for your interest!First off, the USB drive. I can't see any reason why it WOULDN'T work, though you would want to be sure your flash drive is at least 32GB, probably 64 or even 128 at least for a satisfactory install. Qubes is a disk hog with all of its VMs, and while this is somewhat mitigated by it's template system, even that still takes up a lot more space than a traditional OS. IIRC, an installed Qubes OS 3.2 (with no updates, software, configuration, user files, etc.) is over 20GB before you do anything at all. Running off a USB drive may also introduce some performance issues, given that in Qubes starting and stopping VMs happens quite frequently and the T400 only has USB 2.0. I would worry that it would be extremely sluggish running off a flash drive. In fact, Qubes is one of the few systems in the world for which I insist that a good SSD is the only sane way to use it. As for the security impacts of running it off a flash drive, I don't know for sure, but I can't imagine it's all that bad. The one thing I would worry about would be the possibility for easier tampering or theft than a regular hard drive, though disk encryption should at least partially mitigate that. Qubreboot, as it stands, does not set up Qubes for /boot encryption, so in a highly security-sensitive use case, I suppose a flash drive would mean it was easier to tamper with your Xen image or GRUB config? What is your reason for wanting to use a flash drive? No spare hard disks, or something security-related (e.g. carry your disk at all times to avoid Evil Maid attacks or have an easily destructible storage device)? Remember that unlike Tails, Qubes is NOT an amnesic operating system and its storage is very much stateful.As for other OSes, I think it would work, though be sure to check that it's actually needed! Qubes encounters the "out of memory" error, but other installers may work out of the box. If they have similar problems, I suspect Qubreboot would work for them provided you set it up properly (e.g. some partition sizes may be wrong, can't predict what else might happen but I suspect it could be made to work).

9880	 __ah	 Zcash's fungibility applies to coins that have been in shielded pool and when made transparent, didn't use silly patterns which lead to linkability. You can do this to any coins on the chain at any time.I think we agree that Zcash, in its current state, isn't good for people who don't know what they're doing. It permits people to make mistakes that don't help their privacy.But if you know what you're doing, you can get a lot of privacy out of Zcash without leaving yourself vulnerable. It's really cool tech, but it isn't as accessible as it should be for users to get a lot of privacy. This is stuff they can resolve, and they're working to do so (the new MPC and the Sapling update will give people less dependence on trust and provide a lower barrier to shielded transactions, hopefully allowing exchanges and web wallets to start using shielded transactions by default).

9887	 JeffersonsSpirit	 Torbrowser is a heavily modified Firefox ESR. Many features are disabled and I believe cruft is removed, noscript and https everywhere added (and Torbutton), and a few features relative to the cause of anonymity are added (like the canvas request notifier).If everyone switches away from Firefox and Mozilla goes under, Torbrowser devs will either need to fork the latest ESR and maintain the entire browser themselves, or they'll need to switch to a Chromium-based version. This again results in a browser monoculture with Google at the helm, and that is not good for the open web.	
9888	 JeffersonsSpirit	 I agree. I use Torbrowser for research and some random browsing. I also have Firefox for stuff I wouldn't mind the world seeing.Compartmentalization is a valid approach :)

9906	 dexer	 What will it take for these corporate dummies to realize that ads are considered among the most obnoxious user experiences by so many?Humble self-advertisement like Wikipedia is totally fine. Even with the popups they had, I didn't mind it at all. It's a good reminder that a great service needs funding. I'd even be fine if they added a price tag example of what software like FF would usually cost a consumer, to run an organization like FF.Hosting for-profit companies' ads, though....that's totally selling themselves off, and forcing obnoxious foreign content into the lives their users.As good as a service might be, as soon as obnoxious ads make their appearance I morally disengage myself from that service. I like and care about good and useful works, and the people that make them, but ads are like the deadbeat friend you accidentally let stay in your house. Regardless of however much you care about the troubles they're going through, eventually you just can't put up with their shit anymore and want them out of your house regardless of the consequences to them.	
9907	 Antabaka	 It's a card on the new tab page that you can turn off, and it's the most privacy conscious form of advertising since it was all printed. It lets Mozilla ditch their reliance on Google. I don't see how people are making this out to be a bad thing.	
9908	 Antabaka	 They are wholly owned by the foundation (no shareholders) and operate as an arm of it. All of its profits are reinvested in the Mozilla project, its board is selected by the Foundation, and as a result of the structuring if they don't operate on [Mozilla's stated purposes](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/) the foundation will lose their non-profit status.If you mean "run" as in "managed", that's not really the case either, but that's a whole other story.	
9909	 momzapede	 don't you like our global village, number 9?	
9910	 mrchaotica	 &gt; if you haven't disabled pocket on your newtab page already (which is trivial to do)Yeah, that's a lie. To be "trivial," there would have to be a "completely disable everything even slightly related to Pocket" checkbox in `about:preferences`. Instead, you have to:1. Go to `about:config`2. Click through a scary warning3. Set `extensions.pocket.enabled` to `false`4. Go to your new tab page5. Click on the `?` icon on the "Recommended by Pocket" line6. Uncheck "Recommended by Pocket" on the new tab preferences...and for all I know, probably a few other steps too. I had to look up how to do it, and I'm *still* not sure it's completely gone!	
9911	 Antabaka	 Uncontrolled plugins and features? Is this based on the iRobot thing? It's literally one line in [autoconfig.js](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Enterprise_deployment) to disable Shield studies. Were they deploying it without any setup? Users would be able to install add-ons...	
9912	 lurkalypse	 I disagree with the idea that reporting browser and resolution warrants being thrown on a block list. I mean honestly, could you really track a user from just that? I'm not a security expert so if someone is please correct me if I'm wrong but I think you need more than that for fingerprinting.As a developer you need some basic reporting and what browsers, screen sizes, and resolutions are important data to give you an idea of where you need to focus your (front end) development efforts. There's nothing malicious about trying to understand what you're developing for. When you start going beyond technical analytics and start going into the 'marketing' side of them you start getting creepy. Like dropping a cookie to follow your users around the web or getting their email address and renting a list to cross reference in order to build a profile of that user.Of course you have some grey areas too. Like a big site using IP to determine the closest server to content delivery or tracking hits and bounces.TL;DR In my opinion if the analytics are relevant to the technical side of things so you can deliver the best possible experience, and you're not collecting enough to fingerprint or otherwise identify, it's ethical.	
9913	 Antabaka	 They would switch to Chromium, or whatever rises out of the ashes of Firefox. They don't have the funding to develop a browser - even their modifications to Firefox have been brought over for Mozilla to maintain.

Just click the gear icon on newtab page and [uncheck it there](https://winaero.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/disable-pocket-new-tab-page-firefox.png).The fact that you feel threatened by any kind of presence of Pocket code (which is open source and owned by Mozilla) in your browser is another story.

9930	 Disclandr	 When you connect your phone with usb cable to a computer there should be a dialog on your phone that pops up and asks "Do you authorize this connection for data browsing or for charging only?"When you click authorize (or maybe in the past you clicked authorize and also ticked the checkbox "do not ask me again for this phone") after that the phone is decrypted	
9931	 XiovV	 Hmm I didn't get that, maybe because I plugged in the phone before encryption? I'm on LineageOS if that helps.	
9932	 ilzxbuny	 It's open source software. It's not like they're hiding it; you can literally see the source code that shows it's enabled before you install it. It's up to you as a user to read license agreements and determine whether or not you agree to them before using the software. Thankfully there are not laws that prevent developers from enabling options when releasing open-source software.	
9933	 FvDijk	 I'm having trouble taking that site seriously. In an article on Google 'not knowing who Jesus is' they take that as an offensive thing, while (from the same article) Google states they do that for every religious leader as content from the internet can be somewhat.. well... you know.A site that reinforces 'my view or no view' shouldn't really be called an authority on privacy. I think that's the whole point.

9935	 ondondil	 Seriously, since r/privacy got more popular I've been having the feeling that big part of this community just wants to see drama and have someone to blame. There have been numerous threads with hundreds of upvotes which were just spreading misinformation. Some people don't even read the content of articles and write comments based solely on clickbaity title. There are still some sane users here who just try to share their valuable knowledge but it seems that they're becoming a minority :-(	
9936	 jawz101	 And Brave runs on a business model as well.  I don't understand why it's any better.	
9937	 KickMeElmo	 Agreed, but here we are.

9940	 bertvandepoel	 I agree that resolution and most processed user agents can't be used for finger printing and are very very useful when designing front ends. The weird thing is, https://easylist.to/2011/08/31/what-is-acceptable-first-party-tracking.html claims that everything is private data. However when looking at the easyprivacy list, I notice they give exceptions to the Piwik installations of certain news papers and open source projects. So I'm not too sure whether this rather old article is still relevant. I found it really weird and it prompted me to create this topic, hoping to hear from more people who think like me, as well as people having a more extreme view. EDIT: typo	
9941	 distant_worlds	 &gt; RiseUp seems to help all who would like to stay anonymous - violent groups like antifa obviously have a need to so it's no wonder they would use their services. It's invite-only.   And the entire website is filled with antifa rhetoric, they're not exactly subtle.	
9942	 distant_worlds	 &gt;  the most privacy conscious form of advertising Contradiction in terms.  Internet advertisers *always* want to violate privacy.	
9943	 Antabaka	 It doesn't matter what advertisers want, and that's completely obvious if you had any idea what we're talking about here.To quote [a comment of mine](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/7sv4cb/update_on_pocket_and_firefox_integration/dt7yre1/) from the r/Firefox thread about this days ago:--https://help.getpocket.com/article/1142-firefox-new-tab-recommendations#sponsoredstories&gt; Your privacy is of the utmost important to us. The same data policies outlined above apply to sponsored recommendations in the same way. Except for an aggregated total count of impressions and clicks that a particular item receives, sponsors do not receive any data.You can then see what they outlined in the original article. Some quotes:&gt;* If the “Recommended by Pocket” feature is enabled, Pocket will send a list of the best stories on the web to Firefox every day.&gt;* With each story, Pocket also sends a list of related websites that, when visited, signal likely interest in the story.&gt;* Your Firefox browser compares your browsing history with the list of related websites to sort and filter through each day’s stories and recommend the ones that are most likely to interest you.&gt;* **Important Note: Neither Mozilla nor Pocket receives a copy of your browser history. The entire process of sorting and filtering which stories you should see happens locally in your copy of Firefox.**Emphasis theirs. They also link [this article](https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/blob/master/docs/v2-system-addon/data_events.md) for details about what Mozilla collects on the new tab page (aka activity stream) when you have telemetry enabled.---And if you choose to not believe them, you can [test it yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/7sv4cb/update_on_pocket_and_firefox_integration/dt7r7sr/) or just read the source code.	
9944	 Wantfornothing	 Easy there fellow redditor, I don’t sway the rule of the mothership only reporting here that I was affected by it. I run most of my own tools, Firefox included, from a VM that is outside of the Corp desktop realm of totalitarian control. I just thought it was interesting that FF got the axe for this kind of shit. 	
9945	 syboxez	 I love Searx. Personally, I host it myself so I can customize the options without needing to keep cookies in my browser, as I clear them on closing anyway.	
9946	 StainlessPot	 If they were to be money-starved, they would not exist. It's the way companies work, they are there to make profit. Now, I agree these ads alienate users, but clearly Mozilla thinks this doesn't outweight the potential influx of money. It's left to us, the users, to make big enough of a problem out of it, to prevent it.

Makes ya just wanna run out and buy more ?As long as Apple doesn't wimp out...and keeps on kicking them - they'll get more $$$ from us. Didya ever hear about Signal? Good stuff.....'nuther "squeal" app.30+ year Apple hater. Overpriced and underwhelming....only now they have the FBI director selling their hardware for them. He's been a good spokesman.Go for the squeal. You won't regret.	
9949	 dlemaymt	 Not a fair comparison though: Chrome ties in to Google Search and other services, which display ads that Chrome itself will explicitly not block.Chrome is financed by advertising, though indirectly.	
9950	 unsightly-protusion	 Time to download Brave.	
9951	 frankster	 Firefox can fuck right off. Ultimately if they can't get google to carry on funding them several hundred million dollars a year then they're fucked and I don't see how they can make enough money to survive. Doing shitty advertising that antagonises their users will hasten their demise.	
9952	 LifeLikeAndPoseable	 How is this suppose to work? Censorship like China? Am I the only one that doubts that minors are interested in porn? Online included. But if they *are*, they are probably adolescents. And it's very natural for adolescents to be curious about fornication. It is part of nature. Maybe the UK gov got it all wrong, and the real problem is parents watching online porn *together with* their minors? 	
9953	 bawolf	 Biometrics are just usernames, just like SSNs. Only, If someone gets a hold of them they can pretend to be you, and there's nothing you can do to change them ever.	
9954	 distant_worlds	 &gt;  It's the way companies work, they are there to make profit. The mozilla foundation is a non-profit.	
9955	 PrivacyRabbit	 While I question the feasibility of such a program, the government is indeed setting a worrying trend, with the idea of privacy out of the window in an attempt to stem the flow of under 18s watching porn. I highly doubt it will have much of an effect on the majority of the effected, with most simply finding ways to bypass said restrictions, but instead further strip away the few layers of privacy that remain on the web. 	
9956	 LPlantarum	 Yeah but the Zcash Dev team is what created the currency with a Zk-snarks privacy system, the Zclassic coin is just a fork of  zcash. They don't have the amazing development team that will continue to push the scope for privacy research, at least in my opinion.	
9957	 Unathletic_Failure	 Would it be possible for you to go into detail about the fishy things they have done in the past with other projects?	
9958	 PrivacyRabbit	 On top of your list I'd recommend **Decentraleyes**, as well as the **DuckDuckGo** browser extension. 	
9959	 SCphotog	 I'm fairly disgusted with the way firefox has been headed for some time now... the most recent updates included. With updates turned off... if you miss more than two, it nags you to update.I'd have thought that manually turning the updates off, having gone to the trouble to do so would have been enough data for Mozilla to know and understand that I'll update when I prefer to, that I'm responsible enough to do it when needed and not before.But... No... in this always online world, where Google, Microsoft, etc... are getting away with this bullshit, Mozilla doesn't want to be left behind, so they nag me.I was OK with it, in that I figured I could go to about:config and disable the nag... I assume I can, I haven't done it yet.But... you know what, this article tells me all I need to know, to just go ahead and start using BRAVE. I had already installed it on two of my PC's, tried it, found it to be acceptable in a cursory way, but hadn't taken the time to move over my bookmarks, passwords etc... but now I see the time has come.Sayonara Mozilla, I admired you once... some time ago.	
9960	 xgwujrep	 An addon to toggle off javascriptRemove flash from your machineI trust the EFF and therefore their privacy badger. YMMV	
9961	 recognovit_ignotum	 The best I can recommend, from my personal experience is if you really want to go private use a combination of Opera Browser with it's built in VPN and ad-blocker. It is also possible to be traced by computer screen size. Or heck just install TAILS on a USB and install Tor. The common concept people do not understand about privacy is it is more complex. Normally people do not want to go through that process because of the entire procedure.	
9962	 SCphotog	 Chrome is the single worst privacy violator of them all.	
9963	 SCphotog	 Pretty sure that's long overwith... their contract with Google ended when Chrome became a thing.	
9964	 SCphotog	 Here we were... this will be one the last things I do in a FF browser.

9967	 dan4334	 &gt;It's up to you as a user to read license agreements and determine whether or not you agree to them before using the software.We all know that no one does. All telemetry should be opt in and show the user exactly what is being sent. Without that we have proprietary software that is intentionally vague when it comes to this: Windows 10 comes to mind.	
9968	 nutpantz	 The title should read, "users on secret military bases fail to understand how their phone works"	
9969	 stemid85	 I don't even know what it is, maybe you could enlighten those of us who don't live in your country?Based on google it seems like a membership that provides something across airports, I'm guessing wifi access? Because clear passage through airport security seems too far fetched.This is quite common here too and I've used it. But I'm of the philosophy that if you're going to live and work in a modern connected society then you need to have a public facing profile.The alternative is to go off grid and that is quite drastic.So my goal is more about having cover accounts to protect myself from spam and advertisers by using those accounts, adding perhaps e-mail aliases, when I use services like that. Saving my private accounts for friends, family and business.Edit: Interestingly enough I wasn't so intrigued that I'd enable JS on the clear website and read more about it. They have one of those shitty sites that goes completely blank without JS. 	
9970	 vitoreiji	 &gt; Don't they know that most of the vocal Firefox userbase hates ads?I believe the most of the vocal Firefox userbase hates *tracking*. The fact that ads and tracking are nearly synonymous at this point is, I believe, the very thing they are trying to revert, so they can get ad revenue without destroying your privacy. That's what I got from the article anyway. We'll see.	
9971	 distant_worlds	 If we're quoting our own comments, after someone actually did read the source code and they got caught sending full memory dumps *regardless of the user settings.*  For a company that  claims to respect user privacy, they seem to fail at that goal an awful lot.  https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7nw4os/firefox_has_been_collecting_full_memory_dump/ds5tw7d/Last month it was Looking Glass. Earlier last year it was google analytics. Then there's the Orwellian Mozilla Information Trust Initiative to build censorship right into the browser. And that's on top of Cliqz. Oh, yes, 2017 was quite the tumultuous year for Mozilla.Mozilla clearly wants to spy on its users, but they have to be circumspect about it. A minor "oops" that collects more data is right in line with this. Especially given that this as a critical period when they were transitioning to the Quantum engine. Not some grand conspiracy, as you were suggesting. It's just a small switch, and it gets them more data. And if found, they just fix the "bug". Oops.&gt; They also link this article for details about what Mozilla collects on the new tab page (aka activity stream) when you have telemetry enabled.Advertisers pay per view.  If the browser isn't sending the view data back home, then mozilla wouldn't get paid.  And, hey, what do you know, *quoting from the page you linked:* **"Data is sent to our servers in the form of discreet HTTPS 'pings' or messages whenever you do some action on the Activity Stream about:home or about:newtab pages."**  Every action you take on the "Activity Stream" and new tab page is sent back to Mozilla.  Does that include the list of articles that you saw?  Yep.  Even if the activity page is generated locally, they can get a **ton** of data about your interests.   You see, the activity page is generated from your browsing history.  So the list of what matches is effectively a *search* of your browsing history.  So without seeing the individual URLs, they can infer what sites you visit based on what matched their activity page criteria.  They can then sell that information, too, btw.And that's assuming they don't have another "oops, we've been having your whole browsing history uploaded for.. uh... debugging purposes, that's the ticket!"	
9972	 SixLegsGood	 If the aim is to get rid of their reliance on google, someone at Mozilla must have done the maths. Exactly how many ads will they have to force on each user to replace Google’s cash? This is just a small trial... When will Mozilla ramp up the volume of ads?	
9973	 skidmark-steve	 The Goog.	
9974	 EngelbertHerpaderp	 I don't buy products that go hand in hand with invasive ads. If I was planning on buying a specific Toyota and suddenly the ad for it is all over the fucking place, Hello Honda. I feel like ads are trying to tell me how to feel. What I should wear. What I should eat. What I should drive. Funny thing about getting older....I know what I like. If I want to learn about something, I do my own research on my own time. Ironically enough most of the ads I see most often are for shit I purchased most recently. I'll buy something specific I never saw and ad for and suddenly there it is in ad form. So fucking annoying....	
9975	 footspider	 replace ublock with adnaseum, it has the additional ability to fake click on ads, which tricks the ad provider into wasting that cost. instead of just hiding the ads it sucks them into a word cloud type collage that comes with a monetary PPC estimate of the costs you've made those companies waste. In a full day of normal web browsing you can steal at least $100 from advertisers! that's why google banned them lol.Also like others mentioned, get decentraleyes and privacy badger. And random ua and out of bounds. in the firefox settings, disable 3rd party cookies and enable tracking protection all the time. turn off all analytics and data uploading. and remove all the search engines except duckduckgo. clearing private data on exit is a good idea too, but less of a concern if you have good infosec otherwise	
9976	 SixLegsGood	 It’s always ‘just one line in the config’ after each successive anti-user anti-privacy decision by Mozilla. Problem is, there’s a hell of a lot of config lines. After a certain amount of kicks in the face by the company, people tend to not trust them any more. The Mr. Robot plugin fiasco was an especially dumb move.	
9977	 black_back_bat	 Not necessarily, but you should sign up to it with your name online so you can be 100% sure that it’s under your control?	
9978	 BenedictusTheWise	 Indeed, this law isn't in place to protect children, teenagers will always find a way, it's to exploit the older generations out of their data under the guise of "THINK OF THE CHILDREN".	
9979	 BenedictusTheWise	 Supposedly any website which fails to enact the restrictions and verifications which the government has recommended will be blocked by all British ISPs.	
9980	 old_brit_man	 Who is number one 	
9981	 blueskin	 The stench continues to rise from the bloated corpse of Firefox.	
9982	 blueskin	 Vivaldi.Or Brave, if you prefer a browser by a raging bigot, but I don't think the customisability is there compared to Vivaldi / old Firefox.	
9983	 blueskin	 Neither is acceptable.TBFH I'd pay £20 for an ad-free, bloat-free, customisable, non-resource-hog, privacy-respecting browser. I'm sure I'm not the only one. Especially if it had built-in functionality from important addons (NoScript, adblocking, etc.).	
9984	 m0nSTaRw0w	 thanks for your tips, i will test the settings and the addons that you have suggested to me.Some settings are already right but the addons are good to increase the privacy. :)	
9985	 tejmin	 Didn't vivaldi just have some issues connecting to servers?[Can you make more sense of this, than I?](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7tjgpy/vivaldi_caught_incorporating_spyware_connectivity/)	
9986	 Survival300	 Ugh....	
9987	 one_is_the_loneliest	 Also, a lot of people just seem to not want to see ads and to get content for free. I've seen numerous recommendations to just pirate things, when I have absolutely no problem with paying for content provided I don't have to compromise my privacy to do so (e.g. I don't like DRM, but that doesn't mean I'll prefer to pirate).Services offering free content need to get paid for the content, so I disable my ad blocker for services that I use constantly that don't offer a paid, ad-free experience and whose ads don't track me (e.g. I'll disable uBlock Origin, but not privacy badger).	
9988	 MrTimscampi	 Open source is pretty left-leaning ideologically, I think.The concept of sharing, being totally open and free to do whatever is pretty "communist" (for lack of a better term), so it always surprises me to see very right-wing people in the community.Not that I don't like it, mind you. The more opinions we have, the better. Diversity isn't only about male or female, black or white, gay or straight, it's also about different ways of thinking.	
9989	 altobase	 A large portion of americans dont support the mass surveillance of the US. Don't assume that everything the government does is necessarily the will of the people.	
9990	 nutpantz	 Not for me. I read nothing that said it included a firewall like afwall (which is the only one I could trust to do the job)And no root..Without root I can't install a firewall, or properly administrate my device..That would be like having a computer that you could not reinstall or change the operating system. Or delete things you did not like..It's a computer.. A small computer. Treat it like one	
9991	 ImVeryOffended	 The timing is perfect..1.)  Mozilla's balls once again being kept in Google's purse.2.)  Mozilla starts sticking ads in their browser.I figured they would at least wait a while so they could *try* to pretend these things weren't related, but I guess I figured wrong.	
9992	 ImVeryOffended	 They're thinking "we sold our balls to Google again, so we better start acting the part".	
9993	 bigfig	 Horrible!  Better to trust that information with Experion, Equifax, Transunion and Innovis.	
9994	 KickMeElmo	 See, I can't agree with that stance. Pocket may have been integrated, but there's still a single config setting to disable it entirely, no remnants whatsoever. They haven't ever implemented anything potentially unwanted that you couldn't just disable (sans the move to webextensions, but there are novels written on that topic at this point, and most people agree it needed to happen). While I may scowl about some minor decisions they make, this isn't one that will alienate me. Overall they still have the right goals in mind and do good work to implement them, and the next best option other than modified versions of Firefox itself is absolutely awful anyway.	
9995	 caribou16	 You are number six!ORYou are, number six!	
9996	 Chipware	 It's like TSA Pre but by a private for-profit corporation.  When you sign up, they collect biometric data about you and an annual fee.  At the airport, they scan your biometric data, then escort you past the security lines to the TSA podium.I was granted a free membership to it years ago, before it went bankrupt and was purchased by another company.  It's mostly pointless now as TSA Pre is cheaper, available at more airports, and slightly less invasive.  I don't know why Clear is still in business or how they intend to compete with TSA Pre long term.	
9997	 FatMan832	 You are not supposed to give out your social security number to anyone. Read the back of the card. But, try to buy a new car, get a cell phone, open a bank account, get a Comcast account, get an apartment, etc. They all demand a SS# and refuse to do business with you without one. 	
9998	 circuscommando	 I don't want that either.  I want a better funded Mozilla,  I'd rather more 501(c)(3) donations and grant-based funding covered their work.Don't get me wrong, I've been using firefox for years and I'm stoked that we have it, but a lot of the directions FF has been taking recently have bothered me.  I'd rather the browser just keep focusing on security and privacy primarily.  I have waterfox on one of my other machines.  I might just switch the rest of mine over too.	
9999	 hb9nbb	 They need to add"which will then be stolen and released by hackers" to any form requiring data disclosure to the govt because shit happens...	
10000	 nutpantz	 Yes I completely agree. A password is only as good as the decency of your opponent. That why some countries have holding cells on foreign soil.So they can stop being decent any time they wish.	
10001	 recognovit_ignotum	 The reason [duckduckgo](https://duckduckgo.com) is recommended a lot because of there [Privacy Policy](https://duckduckgo.com/privacy). They are designed to provide maximum privacy but making it's GUI similar to Google's for simplicity. 	
10002	 sigavpn	 IMO they're great, our domain sigavpn.org is registered by them and no problems so far.

10005	 Geminii27	 People would be forced to straighten out the government's shit on their own time and at their own expense.	
10006	 Hello-Im-Random	 Honestly, this is disgusting and wrong on many levels. On the upside, I'm going to have quite a good laugh when the government learns what torrents are.	
10007	 Geminii27	 &gt; How would you go about creating a non invasive ID system?Create an ID system. Make it comprehensive. Make it able to store whatever information a citizen wants to be on it, without them being forced to store information they do not want.Make it *absolutely illegal* for that ID to be mandatory for anything. No government or private entity would be allowed to demand that it be used for any kind of ID, access, or transaction, or refuse a transaction if the ID was not used, and other forms of ID must not be more significantly difficult or expensive to use.Personally, I'd also have the ID be optionally active/responsive at a citizen's request, meaning that every time they go to use it they have to specifically choose which items of information will be electronically extractable from the card; the card will not be readable otherwise, and all information stored will be encrypted to avoid deep-level scanning.	
10008	 chmsant	 No	
10009	 jmw74	 I bought the device and I'm happy with it. Without all that spyware, the battery lasts a really long time. Security and privacy enhancements are largely invisible but I have no reason to think they're not working as intended.	
10010	 Kotee_ivanovich	 What if the files permission is enabled?	
10011	 Geminii27	 Honestly, if someone wanted to deepen the divide between a country's citizens and a rabid kneejerk government prone to overreaction and not checking, this is one way to do it.	
10012	 comatoseMob	 America isn't a democracy anymore, ever since corporations were allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money on campaigns and lobbyists we've been living under an Oligarchy. The people's wishes aren't what gets implemented into policy. 	
10013	 Antabaka	 I think pioneering one of the only forms of fully private advertising is definitely a good thing for the future of privacy.As for using Waterfox: Good, please don't ever switch to a Bink based browser (Chrome/ium, Brave, Vivaldi) - it would give Google complete control over the future of internet standards.	
10014	 SCphotog	 I think you're making excuses for Mozilla.	
10015	 Antabaka	 It was, but I'm talking about executive deployments. Using the extended support release and a simple autoconfig.js file makes it dead simple and avoids any issue.As for users, I'll say that the preferences have changed in the last year or so in *response* to these things, which unfortunately leads people to the conclusion that the preferences change around. They really don't. 	
10016	 ZaphodBeebblebrox	 Or vpns, or those shitty browser extensions that work as proxies...	
10017	 iSwearNotARobot	 Been using it for a couple weeks and having any more than 6tabs in two windows brinfs my system to a halt with 16GB ram, 1tb ssd, 1.5GB video memory etc	
10018	 Antabaka	 There are 3 tiles shown at the moment, so without redesigning the newtab page *again* to show more, the max they could show at once is 3. But I doubt they would ever go over 1, that would be really bad UX.And nothing is being forced on anyone, you can disable it with a simple and very obviously worded checkbox.	
10019	 Geminii27	 AKA "Firefox to be blocked at the router"	
10020	 nutpantz	 "Reddit is fun" wanted access to way too many things for what it does.Seriously, it needs access to my nfc and proximity sensor? And it uses the (Google is watching) android accounts manager?Uninstalled it as soon at I saw all of that."Side"wanting access to my primary clipboard without me trying to copy or paste anything is a little worrying. I'll look at the others	
10021	 Antabaka	 Looking Glass was a blunder. The Google Analytics thing a basic mixup - they run it on their websites, and the page that gets embedded in about:addons is one of their websites. The "Orwellian" thing you refer to literally has nothing to do with building censorship into the browser. Cliqz is indeed one of Mozilla's many **privacy** endeavors - a search engine that actually respects user privacy.And good job, you've pointed out that they use telemetry.All of this can be disabled with a few basic preferences. But we all know why so many minor stories are being blown up: Internet Outrage has a home on the right, and Mozilla looks a little bit like the left. I'm so tired of this.	
10022	 nutpantz	 By location do you mean the address on the street you are at or your GPS coordinates?	
10023	 roosterinflight	 Not having proper identification is not a failure of the government. It is a failure of the individual. Why is it liberals always try to pass the buck of individual accountability to the collective?	
10024	 blackomegax	 The problem with this, is that eventually it'd end up like the genetic alterations in gattaca, or present day stigma against not having a facebook account, but at an official level."So, we've denied your loan due to low trustworthiness. This metric is proprietary. Goodbye"	
10025	 Geminii27	 Because it's the collective which wants that control over the individuals in the first place.Why, as an individual, would I actually *need* identification to live? What part of life processes need an ID card as a fundamental component?ID isn't something individuals want. It's something governments and control freaks who desperately want to control everyone else want.

10027	 footspider	 Parents worldwide can keep their kids from watching porn now by putting a British VPN on their computers and phones 	
10028	 jawz101	 There's no confusion here.With half a billion dollars, Mozilla Foundation shouldn't need to have Mozilla Corporation.  They could run off of investment interests or something and not have to throw Pocket and sponsored ads and search engines at its users.  To stand for privacy, if they can afford it they could be financially secure and also remain neutral.  Instead they have CEO's, a Board of Directors, marketing strategies and all of that business.

Our specific goals as an organization are outlined in the Mozilla Manifesto. We are activists for the open Web. Mozilla has a long history of gathering people with a wide diversity of political, social, and religious beliefs to work with Mozilla.Just stay with free and open Web.	
10029	 Atello	 So what's the government gonna do to the kids of the people who supported this?	
10030	 deadzzed	 No problem.  I have updated the post as you requested.	
10031	 doofy666	 &gt; replace ublock with adnaseum, it has the additional ability to fake click on ads, which tricks the ad provider into wasting that cost.All Adnauseum does is cost money for web sites.Ad providers recognise that a bot is clicking the ads and so withhold revenue from websites.	
10032	 crypto_meme	 Governments are slow, courts are slow. No way in hell they will be able to keep up with the speed of new mirrors being created. EDIT: Nevermind. They are going to be able to mass block websites without any court orders. Fuck democracy I guess. Also, 90% of websites contain some sort of 18+ content, they can't seriously expect people to give over their info to that many companies.	
10033	 roosterinflight	 No, the collective wants compliance from those that participate in the system. You're not entitled to the benefits of that system. You earn them with good behavior and tax money.To live? You don't. Take off into the woods, and take care of yourself. To live *in socoety*? Duh. To help identify you separately from other individuals. You know, for things like justice, benefits, payment, etc.And no, not control freaks. Just people that are tired of seeing their tax money being used for unethical things, like giving illegal immigrants welfare and voting rights.

10035	 KomputerIdiat	 Hey I know it has been awhile, but I got this "ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64" in a fresh 16 GB Kingston USB. It is the only file in there. How come when I restart, it does not give me the option to install the Linux OS? I even went into the BIOS option to specifically boot it from there but it says something along the line of either: A. No OS was detected, click any key to restart, or B. literally blanks out then returns to the BIOS.

10039	 footspider	 Hypothetically that's possible but I haven't seen any evidence that that's a remotely common practice, let alone a large enough majority to make it worth not botclicking. From my experience in the ad industry, companies pay the ad hosters up front and whether or not they can request a refund after detecting bot clicks depends on a bunch of policies and contracts

10046	 distant_worlds	 &gt; The Google Analytics thing a basic mixup - they run it on their websites, and the page that gets embedded in about:config is one of their websites. A set of web pages built into the browser system that is specially excluded from webextensions, so you can't even block it via ublock.&gt; The "Orwellian" thing you refer to literally has nothing to do with building censorship into the browser. It's literally an initiative wherein Firefox will decide what is true or not and have the browser tell you so.  The only silver lining is that it is likely another place where they simply threw money at something that would make them feel good and never see the light of day.&gt; Cliqz is indeed one of Mozilla's many privacy endeavors - a search engine that actually respects user privacy.To quote from their press release: *"Users who receive a version of Firefox with Cliqz will have their browsing activity sent to Cliqz servers, including the URLs of pages they visit"*   Maybe you don't know what privacy is?&gt;  All of this can be disabled with a few basic preferences. Most of it requires about:config (and some things not even there), except when there's a "bug" that causes all of your data to be uploaded to Mozilla anyway, including your usernames and saved password, regardless of any settings you put in.While Mozilla constantly claims to care about privacy, they have consistently shown the opposite through their actions.&gt; Internet Outrage has a home on the right, and Mozilla looks a little bit like the left. Hahahhahaha!  You think Internet Outrage is any different on the left and right?   HAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

10066	 BlueZarex	 No dude...we have to correct the government shitty existing records because they suck. Furthermore, since I am a victim of the OPM data breach that was one hundred percent the governments fault to not protect government records, this sounds like a fucking nightmare. China literally has my Govt Clearance Application which contains a hell of a lot more information than this national ID would. If the Govt didn't protect *those* records, why the hell would you assume they can protect these records? Shit...talk about a national security nightmare. China has the US govt files on everyone with Clearance in The United States. 	
10067	 HannasAnarion	 [No, but a solid majority of Americans have wanted ID cards since 2002 at least.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/02/19/americans-feel-the-tensions-between-privacy-and-security-concerns/)ID cards do not equal mass surveillance. You do not need a database or internal tracking to make national ID useful. If those things were a natural consequence of national IDs, then the Social Security Administration would have already done it. Everybody already has a number from the government. Can we *please* put some security on it? The US is basically the only developed country in the world with an identity theft problem, representing 70% of global cases. Would it really be that bad to put a damn picture on your social security card?	
10068	 paleseed	 Wow you're right, don't know why I didn't bother looking at their actual website.  Their terms of service clearly state that their service is only available to persons and groups who hold very specific political views.I've edited my previous comment to correct the claim that privacy is their goal.Sorry for the downvotes, I guess nobody else bothered looking either.

10070	 nutpantz	 That depends on what apps you need to run and how technical your knowledge and skills are. Cygenmod ended at 6.01 for the most part after that lineage took over. NO BASE ROOM IS 100% SECURE in Android but some are better than others.	
10071	 HannasAnarion	 &gt; It's also a bit of a straw man since SSN's are not any form of national ID officiallyCall it what it is. SSN was not *intended* to be an ID, but that doesn't change the fact that it *is* an ID. If somebody wants to know who you are, you give them your SSN, and then they go "ah, nice to meet you Mr Spants, let me give you a loan". I don't care how the law was written in 1930. That's an ID. Would it really destroy your privacy if you put your picture on it? 	
10072	 TrashMacNugget	 Rather than copying the file, the image has to be written to the USB to make it bootable. If you're on Windows, you can use [Rufus](https://rufus.akeo.ie).Select "Create a bootable disk using [ISO image]", and choose the ISO file. (Note you probably want to select the copy that _isn't_ on the USB already, otherwise you might have some issues.)Let me know if that works for you.	
10073	 ChalupaBatmanWasHere	 Does privacy badger do the same thing as the new duckduckgo extension?	
10074	 KomputerIdiat	 K thanks. I just ran into a problem where the file is downloaded directly onto the USB itself and running it on Rufus tells me "Error: Access to the device is denied" or something. Is the location of the file in question like another user told me? 	
10075	 [deleted]	 [removed]	
10076	 H7LzhZxV5fvJaAjjeiew	 &gt;  And no root.. Without root I can't install a firewall, or properly administrate my device.. You have to realize there is an important reason behind this, security. Rooted devices will always be more vulnerable then devices that deny root. Also it includes a locked bootloader, which most other ROMs do not do, again for maximum security.	
10077	 H7LzhZxV5fvJaAjjeiew	 Excellent ROM, the combination of no-gapps, FDroid and a lockable bootloader is perfect.&gt; Pay 1100$?Nope, just install it for free on a slightly older model.	
10078	 roosterinflight	 So moving to a more secure system is bad because it is too much effort for some citizens?	
10079	 TrashMacNugget	 Try moving Rufus as well as the ISO ("ubuntu-16.04.3-desktop-amd64") somewhere other than the USB drive and trying again.	
10080	 paleseed	 Yeah I misunderstood.  I figured they were running on a pro-privacy platform, but it seems they only offer their services to those who share the founders political agenda.Squandered opportunity in my opinion.  Maybe somebody will come along and offer similar services for all.	
10081	 i_mormon_stuff	 Their idea is that you will register with one company and that account will then be like your passport. You will then login to your normal pornographic website which will ask to link to your "porno passport" account.Like when you use Twitter or Facebook to login to a non-Twitter/Facebook website to leave a comment on a news story or something.Whole thing is ass-backwards to me. UK Government are horrid. EDIT:// Also apparently this system has been built by Pornhub who won the government contract for this thing. Sad.	
10082	 USAisDyingLOL	 How many social security numbers need to be stolen before they're no longer useful as an identifier?How many identity thefts need to take place before credit reporting agencies lose their power?How many viruses that implant terrorist manifestos or child porn need to infect people's computers before those things are no longer a crime? And how many times can governments overreact before people refuse to obey?It all seems like the "I am Spartacus" situation, except it never seems to come to fruition	
10083	 ablackminute	 Not like a dem gvt would be the opposite	
10084	 DustinBones13	 What will the penalty be for not carrying your government-mandated ID card? There may not be one right away, but what about down the road? Don’t you think some congressperson with an authoritarian bent will eventually come up with some rationalization as to why we should all be required to carry our national ID cards at all times? (“Your papers, please.”) The evolution from a free society to a surveillance state is a gradual and insidious process.	
10085	 YumiYumiYumi	 &gt; I mean honestly, could you really track a user from just that?It can depend on the traffic profile of your website.  Firstly, it's usually not just the browser and resolution that's being collected, usually there's IP, accessed URL, referrers and other things that can be combined to get a more unique fingerprint.  Even if not, the user agent (browser) + resolution could be a unique-enough identifier to identify most individual users on lower traffic websites.  Not a huge concern IMO, because almost all websites log traffic by default anyway (i.e. without any analytics) and that data can reasonably uniquely identify visitors.  But I thought I'd point it out anyway.	
10086	 nothingduploading	 i know but it is more of warning like nobody pays for facebook. but they track the living shit out of you.	
10087	 nutpantz	 I disagree. Every desktop computer has administration accounts (root) a smart phone should be no different. Do you need to use it? I don't know you. But I do if they're is no firewall(no one in their right mind would use a computer without a firewall),no complete permissions manger(including system applications).A locked boot loader just secures the hardware from "unauthorised use". I decide what is authorised. If Microsoft had their way every desktop would have a locked "boot loader" then Linux would die and your choices would be Windows or Mac. Dumbing things down so it's easier for everyone is not helping anyone but the lowest common denominator. 	
10088	 Wardenclyffe56	 Two solutions: already having porn DLed in your computer, or torrents.	
10089	 WafflHausDildoKiller	 Fuck this. Buy an external HDD and fill it with as much as you can. You've still got a while so get downloading. 	
10090	 Geminii27	 How about a meaningless card an imposter can take from you or copy? Or meaningless biometrics they can copy or spoof? Or a meaningless password they can watch you type?I'm curious as to what kind of identification you're thinking of which couldn't be used by someone else pretending to be you.	
10091	 KomputerIdiat	 I got Ubuntu working :)   Now I have Ubuntu running, I'm looking at this "Ubuntu Software" loading forever. I searched up the forums on why this is, people just tell me to do a clean install with the code:   sudo apt purge gnome-software ubuntu-softwaresudo apt autoremove  sudo apt install gnome-software ubuntu-softwaresudo reboot   Where do you enter that code? And is there another way to reinstall this thing?	
10092	 justonezloty	 I don't want them to have my information. I've been reading about privacy and our rights and I was stupid to voluntarily surrender my information to them. 	
10093	 punaisetpimpulat	 Yeah I've noticed that when experimenting with text based browsers. Just a few sites were readable.Using Reddit with it was "possible" but certainly not a great experience.	
10094	 torpcoms	 That's excessive; sounds like the government really wants those fingerprints, but knows demanding them from everyone will be poorly received by its populace.	
10095	 slyfoxy12	 I beg to differ, I agree it's a poor move and a fairly pointless one but I don't think it's about the data myself. I think it is mainly as a way to win over parents who are complaining about the damages of porn and this is meant to look like a patch to deal with it because outside of Reddit there are people who believe that you can stop people seeing porn.There's a lot of parents out there who really don't want to have to deal with monitoring their children's online activities.	
10096	 Liam2349	 This is going to cause some of the worst data leaks in history. There will be so much blackmailing.Anyone smart enough is already using a VPN.

10100	 N-Bluth	 Agreed, Install it on a Nexus 6P and get a deal. Still a great phone.	
10101	 cojoco	 When I was in Heathrow last month I was using their free WiFi and reddit was blocked for "nudity".So I'm guessing that reddit would qualify as a "porn" site.	
10102	 nutpantz	 First off Ubuntu is the Microsoft of Linux. It's easy to use and it's mostly secure. Every one talks about how Linux is much more secure than Windows. It mostly is, but user friendly apps can still be a huge privacy leak.you are very immune to malware, it at least Linux is. Firefox and chromium are almost their own operating system now so they could be dangerous, or at least the things that abuse them can be. Now you have a lot of reading to do. Make sure you have a firewall running and understand it and how it works.Then learn the next thing. Security is not a destination but a journey. Oh and Ubuntu software store is bloated slow crap. Install synaptic probably command line "app get install synaptic" or similar.	
10103	 Houston_Here	 Or adults too stupid to google VPN.	
10104	 KomputerIdiat	 I just ran through the Ubuntu Software list and I am very unfamiliar to all of them. The uninstallation of them is also difficult because when I click the "remove" button, it doesn't quite do it the first time but I sometimes have to remove it again. This OS does not have a firewall built in like Windows 10? What software do you recommend? Do I have to get Bitdefender for it as well? mmm...I am only using a 250GB SSD and Windows 10 is already occupying a huge chunk of it already...   I'm trying this Guest Session on Ubuntu, but how do I install things and control what is also installed for the guests?   What do I uninstall to begin with? I think I have removed the Amazon thing. Oh and video streaming is not working except at Youtube. 	
10105	 sunaflare	 It's worrying for me on two fronts: the act of asking for such information and the type of information. I mean, there are porn sites that you can subscribe to which have your details but to make it mandatory screams future security and maintenance risks	
10106	 HannasAnarion	 How about a meaningless lock on your door too? Just because you can't stop all criminals everywhere forever doesn't mean you have to make yourself easier to rob. 	
10107	 GarthPatrickx	 This is why VPN's were invented.  Are they going to do away with VPN's?  	
10108	 Exaskryz	 Wiħ any luck, Pornhub took the bid so that they could get it done right and protect users as much as possible wiħin the confines of the new legislation???	
10109	 Exaskryz	 Wonder how this is going to pan out in academic settings.

10112	 nutpantz	 Basically Google "how do i (whatever) in Ubuntu" synaptic is a lot faster than Ubuntu store (which I think had been replaced in the newer versions)A lot of stuff is command line.a lot is more technical than it should be, and a lot of documentation is vague and out of date. Still to this day I use Linux for all my online stuff and Windows offline for games and maps and other things.

10114	 Bluebugjuice2	 Yeah, they can depending on the gift card. If it’s one of the vanilla visa cards, if they wrote down the entire card number and its security code, they can see what website or store you bought from along with the amount and remaining balance.

10120	 soggybiscuit93	 The problem is that a national ID is needed. Because we don't have one, and there exists a need for one, SSN has filled that role.SSN is horrible as being an ID though. It's just a plain text number that if someone finds out, you're screwed	
10121	 soggybiscuit93	 Not true. Google removed audio responses for all religious leaders due to the backlash of Jesus being the only religious leader it didn't have an audio response for	
10122	 TrashMacNugget	 Look for an app called "Terminal" or "Console".    sudo apt-get purge --autoremove gnome-software ubuntu-software &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install gnome-software ubuntu-softwareBy the way, by default Ubuntu Software Center will show non-free apps. If you want to fix that, open the "Software", open the settings (the button upper-left &gt; Software &amp; Updates) and uncheck "(restricted)" and "(multiverse)".	
10123	 H7LzhZxV5fvJaAjjeiew	 &gt; I disagree. Every desktop computer has administration accounts (root) a smart phone should be no different.It's still removing security whether you like it or not. Even on desktop systems the more restricted root is the safer you are.&gt; A locked boot loader just secures the hardware from "unauthorised use". I decide what is authorised.An unlocked bootloader means anyone who gets your phone can pull all the data off it and implant spyware. Amazing that you're the only person on earth who's phone can't be pinched.&gt;  If Microsoft had their way every desktop would have a locked "boot loader" then Linux would die and your choices would be Windows or Mac. A locked bootloader doesn't prevent you from later unlocking it and installing another ROM. Calm down.&gt; Dumbing things down so it's easier for everyone is not helping anyone but the lowest common denominator. Not everyone has a magical phone that a) can never be taken from you, and b) will never run a line of malicious code, ever.For everyone else, there's Copperhead with its sane defaults.

10125	 KomputerIdiat	 Do you mean upper-right?   I got the software thing to work now, but removing apps seems buggy.

You can buy your operating system, pay for programs, pay for your internet service, pay for email, pay for your phone and every app.  And they'll still double dip by selling you out to marketing, or mining your usage for their own purposes.	
10146	 udevNull	 You can use GPG / PGP on any email service. I personally prefer this over protonmail. I think protonmail users will also be able to receive GPG encrypted emails and read them.It requires a secure exchange of GPG public keys, but once that is done, the email service you use becomes irrelevant.Gmail's web client doesn't offer encryption abilities but with things like Thunderbird and enigmail, you can achieve the same thing using your gmail account. AFAIK, you can send encrypted emails from protonmail to a gmail address (provided you have the GPG public key of the gmail address). You just can't read it on the web client, it'll require you to have a desktop application like thunderbird + enigmail installed to read it. [This is based on memory, I may be wrong, somebody else may be able to shed more light on whether or not protonmail can send encrypted emails to arbitrary GPG keys]Google definitely reads your emails. They also serve ads based on the contents of your emails.	
10147	 TrashMacNugget	 Maybe, but censorship is worse.	
10148	 1throwaway932	 I‘d actually fear that in sometime a background check for a job could involve getting the data of the visited sites and watched porn. A VPN is now a must have 	
10149	 Blue-Socks	 That's a blunt assumption	
10150	 _-IDontReddit-_	 You should read up on how Linux works.&gt; I just ran through the Ubuntu Software list and I am very unfamiliar to all of them. The uninstallation of them is also difficult because when I click the "remove" button, it doesn't quite do it the first time but I sometimes have to remove it again.Don't use it then. All the software center is is a shitty frontend for the package manager. Read what a package manager is and how to use Ubuntu's (apt) from the command line.&gt; This OS does not have a firewall built in like Windows 10?It does (iptables) but it's only configurable from the command-line and very complicated to do so. Look up frontends for iptables.&gt; Do I have to get Bitdefender for it as well?Fuck no. Stay away from antivirus software on Linux. Does more harm than good.&gt; but how do I install things and control what is also installed for the guestsSoftware installed through the package manager are system-wide.&gt; Oh and video streaming is not working except at Youtube. Browser issue.	
10151	 nutpantz	 A locked boot loader does NOT encrypt the data on your phone. It stops you from changing the system files.if you can unlock it... It's not LOCKED..And it can't provide any security (which would be factory only updates and changes).And as I said no firewall means its useless to me without the ability to secure unwanted data transfer.no root means no way to administer a firewall.Unless some one can think of a reason to not have a firewall, (Other than people who don't want users to control what apps can transfer data, I'm looking at you Google, Samsung, apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and others)	
10152	 RickeySanchez	 No, because it’s an invasion of privacy, just like online tracking. Just because you don’t care about that privacy or think that people should have nothing to hide is like saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.	
10153	 deadzzed	 Yes, that's mostly true.  However with Protonmail, you can use a bridge on your local computer that supports various e-mail clients, Outlook, Thunderbird, etc.  This client means all of your email is encrypted in transit.  Also, Protonmail will keep all of your email encrypted at rest outside of the US.  	
10154	 nutpantz	  I am experimenting with emails and autocrypt. It auto magically encrypts your email if you mail someone who uses a autocrypt enabled client(which is free and far between) the only real benefit is that it makes it hard for anyone to read your email who should not. (I can think of a few cases where people sent the wrong message to a email address, not that auto crypt would stop that) I think Google has publicly claimed they have stopped reading emails.I expect chromium web browser is so popular they don't have to read email anymore.	
10155	 PsychKnowledgy	 Interesting, like what?	
10156	 nutpantz	 A good vpn over anything is better than no vpn. Cellular data is as secure as your provider wants it.ie they know every web address you connect to.same with home Wi-Fi. Your provider knows everything. Home Wi-Fi is not that hard to break into if you really want to.Cellular can be spoofed by fake cell sites. It's really a matter of how much your adversary cares about laws or how much they will spend.

10164	 jarymut	 What's up with firewall? Windows firewall is not typical firewall by definition, is more like internet-permission manager - it operates on per-app basis, I don't think we have something similar that's easy to use. Also you shouldn't need any of it under linux. And (I hope) default Ubuntu installation does not have any open ports, Windows do (samba, sharing and all that stuff) - that's why you need protection.Don't ask anyone new to Linux to use iptables. In 99% cases they are behind router, built-in firewall there is enough for non-Windows systems. And it's hard to have something better using iptables when you're new to all this.

While I don't think democracy is completely broken or that Google and Facebook is the root of all evil. I know that in the U.S. The NRA has the money to stop all talk of gun control after every mass shooting. I know that Google and Facebook could buy the NRA as a lunch special for their favorite kid to play with while the adults talk.But I also know that no one stays on top forever in a fickle social market.	
10167	 jarymut	 First, welcome in the world of Linux.You are more immune to malware, because there is much less Linux malware out there and it's much much more difficult to catch it on your PC.Firefox is still Firefox, exactly like on Windows, but Window's viruses will not work. You have to do the same things as you would there - HTTPS everywhere + Privacy Badger is a good choice.And with any questions about Ubuntu: just go to their forums, many issues are discussed there: https://ubuntuforums.org. Or https://askubuntu.com. Or just search anywhere, Ubuntu is most popular Linux flavour, there must be answers somewhere.	
10168	 roosterinflight	 What's so invasive?	
10169	 Steppdeckenwolf	 Taking back control, eh?	
10170	 KickMeElmo	 It technically is, but it's an extension you have to disable through about:config. Think the setting is extension.pocket.enabled.	
10171	 jarymut	 Just share your iptables configuration here (just skip any personal open ports/redirections), it's much easier to copy something good that to learn from start what iptables is all about and what table does what.I'm assuming you configured your firewall in the first week of using Linux, otherwise you would not send someone to learn what iptables is.	
10172	 imajortm	 the ISP was talktalk where i was staying (private residence). various torrent hosts were blocked. just couldn’t access the page directly from the address. some material (pdf) such as Ted Kaczynski manifesto just wasn’t around. as if it didn’t exist.  a few examples that i thought were pretty inane in the scheme of things and easily accessible where i am. cleansed...	
10173	 q928hoawfhu	 Fine.  When you UK idiots catch your 17-year-old sons fucking a box of Tide Pods, you'll have some idea what a problem you've created.	
10174	 nutpantz	 You don't have to worry too much about any virus. You need system privileges to install anything, hence the virus can't replicate and infect you. Malware is almost unheard of if you stick to the official repositories. But that will eventually limit you somewhat. I like firewalls but there is no easy one in Linux and I think that's a huge issue when people start playing with wine (Windows emulator) or the modern web browser that can do just about anything a separate os can. But then very little is easy in Linux.but it can be made very secure and private.	
10175	 An0nym17y	 I think 'Airstrip One' has a nice ring to it.

10182	 antenore	 This is just a "Pontius Pilates washing his hands" deal. The UK government is showing they've took measures to protect (really?) kids, but instead they just avoiding responsibilities and costs, that now are all for the pornos industries, the parents and the kids. There is no plot, just shit.... I'm a parent and I speak with my kids about everything, they don't need to hide, I don't need to overwatch, this is how it should work BTW.

10185	 Morris_Dungpile	 no, no it isn't	
10186	 Seudo_of_Lydia	 There are free VPNs. Generally I wouldn't trust them but I can't imagine the penalty for watching porn is worth worrying about. If teenage boys don't know how to use TOR yet I can garentee they'll learn very quickly... Anyone can set up a porn site for next to nothing. Once the UK gov blocks it just set up another one.The real question is how much do tax payers want to spend on puritan legislation? 	
10187	 ApocalypseOfLlamas	 Nah a bunch of women complained so they got rid of it.

10189	 Kimbobbins	 Or y'know, any website outside of the UK which gives them a swift "Fuck off". Twitter, Reddit, Tumblr, Facebook, all full of porn. The fact they think they can censor any of it is completely stupid.	
10190	 Geminii27	 I'd be more likely to use an actual useful lock, rather than a weak one.	
10191	 lodged_in_thepipe	 I'm wondering if that's just parental controls of where you were staying. I'm British and have used TalkTalk, Virgin, Sky and BT as internet providers and no torrent sites have been ever been blocked for me.	
10192	 parm00	 Use cryptocurrencies for privacy.	
10193	 Wardenclyffe56	 Well those are the people this law/bill/whatever is "affecting" the most.	
10194	 castle_kafka	 I think we can safely assume that at some point in the future the browsing history and habits of *every device* will become public - even retrospectively. 	
10195	 Wardenclyffe56	 &gt; Anyone can set up a porn site for next to nothing. Once the UK gov blocks it just set up another one.I mean not one that can be used as many people as say pornhub or xvideos.	
10196	 Seudo_of_Lydia	 Simpler yet just set up a mirror of those site that's hosted in Kazakhstan.Not sure how they will be checking though. Presumably it'll be a blacklist but they could actually trawl sites with an algorithms. That's even scarier considering how many false positives YouTube spits out. Half the internet will be banned. 	
10197	 imajortm	 i’ll tell mum next time i stay over to ease off the parental thing. at 52 ya think she could cut me some slack. 	
10198	 BurgerUSA	 It's the same in Russia. I guess UK government is now our enemy as well. Also pic related https://i.imgur.com/uzi3J9s.png	
10199	 FeatheryAsshole	 arguably, it's the adults it's affecting the most - most people are underage while watching porn for maybe 4-6 years, but they're adults for 60 (assuming average lifespan). 	
10200	 thesean_glider	 or theres snapchat, or twitter, or insta, or tumblr... or channel4	
10201	 Wardenclyffe56	 Now that you mention it, you're right. I remember a few years ago TPB was blocked in my country, but I could just use proxybay to access it (it's been since unblocked but I get my torrents elsewhere).	
10202	 Wardenclyffe56	 Yeah you're right. I was thinking of how said "age verification" can only be obtained by over 18 people, effectively leaving horny younger teenagers out, but clearly the UK govt. having a database of adults who watch porn isn't much better.	
10203	 thesean_glider	 Yes, easy. The registration, login forms for at least a couple of legit ones are mysteriously broken (domains blocked) without any apparent reason why, on major uk isps. Making it a pain to sign up, log in to customer portals unless already on a vpn.	
10204	 theendisnear111	 Good. Pornography is disgraceful and can only produce negative results in a person. It is one of the worst addictions out there. It should be banned all together. Although the intent is to collect your data and gather dirt on you, it will deter away any interest in anyone bothering to search for porn. This is especially helpful to those who desperately want to stop watching porn, but can't because of how easy it is to access it. This can only have positive effects on society (if you ignore the data collection scheme part).

10208	 BlueZarex	  Dude...its not too much effort for citizens...its too much effort for the incompetent govt. They are the ones that have to secure these records and they have been unable to do so - they end up in foreign spies hands for Christ sakes. If they are incompetent at cyber security, you don't hand they even more data to protect. You fix their cyber problems and so far, that hasn't happened, its only gotten worse. We have had more breaches in govt records in the last few years than anytime in the past since they are following Jared's "move everything to the "cloud" instead of secure private govt networks that are not exposed to the internet. Furthermore, I suppose you forget what realID was way back when. There was talk about giving everyone an "InternetID" where you could only get on the internet by signing on with your govID, thereby allowing the govt to know exactly what you did online all the time. Personally, though I am vehemently against such a thing, It would be a sort of poetic justice to expose the Donald users as their exact real life identity all because they wanted to get those dirty immigrants. It will be even more fun when the Dems take back the WH+Congress and all the invasive laws passed under Trump will then be in control of the Dems who can use them for their platform, like taking away your guns, your anonymity online, and everything else about your personal life they want to go after. Remember, laws are forever. They get passed to the next President who might not be a guy you like or trust. 	
10209	 JamaltS	 I really can't see why you're posting this here. Do you want to show a point? That is good to receive ads?

10211	 Hello-Im-Random	 It may work in a way that any website that contains NSFW content would get banned unless it fulfills verification requirements.	
10212	 Hello-Im-Random	 Not so much porn specifically, I'm just an avid opponent of censorship of any sorts and this is one of the worst cases of it.	
10213	 Hello-Im-Random	 Good bot	
10214	 Hadrial	 The same way Google does.	
10215	 maxm	 Luckily there is not room on any of those new 512GB sd cards to store porn, so there is no way to circumvent it.	
10216	 reddit-suckz	 ManWin already put their name forward with an offer to run the database with their massive infrastructure. What could go wrong submitting your drivers license / passport / ID details to the worlds largest pornography company that constantly serves up malware to its customers?&gt;MindGeek also plans to collect a trove of information on users, including their names, addresses, date of birth, as well as their online activities on other websites.	
10217	 maxm	 Germany already censors reddit on a per subreddit basis.	
10218	 reddit-suckz	 &gt; I'm going to have quite a good laugh when the government learns what torrents are.you mean those pesky things that were blocked in the UK years ago?	
10219	 maxm	 I read it for the articles ...	
10220	 reddit-suckz	 so instead of disabling the blocker software, you bought a new hard drive, installed a completely new and different operating system, learnt how to use that, learnt how to code.... stuff.... hey that's amazing... but everyone can just you know... spend 5 seconds and disable the blocking software? lol	
10221	 Kimbobbins	 Okay then that's reddit. Are they going to filter twitter, tumblr and facebook by user? Facebook being in the billions, twitter probably pushing it too.	
10222	 Kimbobbins	 They're really going to require age verification for some of the worlds most trafficed websites. Nah.	
10223	 graffen	 &gt; It requires a secure exchange of GPG public keys, but once that is done, the email service you use becomes irrelevantClarification: You don't need to _securely_ swap public keys, necessarily. Public keys don't have to be kept secret but can be shared by any feasible means. I have my public keys posted on my website for people to grab. However, you need to _trust_ that the public key does, in fact, belong to who you think it does. There are different ways of doing so, but verifying fingerprints through a secure channel like encrypted chat or a phone call is a good option. 	
10224	 1throwaway932	 I totally agree with you, but it scares the shit out of me. I see future politician or ceos stepping down, because of stupid things they did in their teenage/ young adault days. Let’s say, you are into tinder or some other dating app ( or now just because you are watching porn) and leaked stuff from the past will make you  blackmailable.  Doesn’t sound good to me 	
10225	 mxt79	 Even government people and police men are watching porn. This is going to be very very interesting.

10227	 bicode	 Sorry friend I’m going to need some help with this one :(	
10228	 RunePoul	 I disagree, this is obviously about having a legal way for the government to filter and monitor people’s internet traffic. It’s not about pornography, it’s about security. Britain has seen some horrible acts of terrorism and even worse plans. The reason nobody may carry liquids into airports anymore is after the British foiled an Islamic plot in the last minute to blow up ten airliners midair over the Atlantic. Western powers cannot accept this, even if it means taking away the old freedoms of speech and assembly from our constitutions. Those freedoms were luxuries of an opulent past that we can no longer afford, if we wish to remain secure. At least this seems to be the analysis of our masters.	
10229	 SabishiiFury	 The same in Barcelona El Prat.	
10230	 Limitre	 Yeah... this is coming from the government that proposed a ban on encryption. They'll keep trying to patch up holes until they realise how simple it is to circumvent such ridiculous legislation.	
10231	 Hello-Im-Random	 Likely. It would be very impractical and likely repealed by future administrations, but it could happen. Most of these sites already require user to state their age, they just don't verify it. So it wouldn't be that different for them. Heck, it could even benefit them. Data mining would be slightly more reliable this way.	
10232	 Hello-Im-Random	 Were they? I can only find information about some of the torrent sites being blocked and voluntarily so, by ISPs But it's not like this can't be bypassed and easily at that.	
10233	 udevNull	 &gt; However, you need to trust that the public key does, in fact, belong to who you think it does.This is what I tried to say. Thank you for clarifying that.

10235	 australian_user	 https://www.waterfoxproject.org&gt;  There is no plugin whitelist, you can run whichever extensions you like and absolutely no data or telemetry is sent back to Mozilla or the Waterfox project.	
10236	 shiftyduck86	 I think talk talk have filters on by default. I know sky did. You have to manually turn off the filtering software, and it gives lots of scary warnings. I can't remember if it was an account settings or a router setting, I think with sky you need to log into your sky online account.  Having said that, many popular torrent sites are blocked via court order, but torrents themselves aren't.

10240	 lolkep	 Hey, Peter (co-)founder of Njalla, hemlis, The Pirate Bay, lots of other things, here. Hemlis wasn't fishy, it was an honest failure. Bad timing, lack of resources and personal issues like death in families. And in the end Signal, Wire and other competitors had more money and we stopped. Simple. We refunded everyone that asked for a refund from the cash we had left, and we also put in personal money to refund some other after the money was gone. We used the money we raised to pay people (you can look at their taxes to see that). We actually asked people to stop giving us money after we reached enough to make a prototype, and we closed down the crowdfunding. If we wanted to do something sketchy, we would have kept going. The beta was out and peopled liked it, but our competitors had blazed past us and had millions of users already. They could afford the things we couldn't - just verifying a cellphone number costs 0.05-0.1$ each, and if you need a few hundred of thousands (or millions) of users to not be a failure, you need to pay for that. And you need to make sure people buy the app at that time, which noone would since the competition is free and we had no user base to talk about. We also realised that with Signal particularily, the competition already did what we wanted to achieve. We closed down and ended instead of trying to ask for more money or something stupid.Also, I'm the only one from Njalla that was involved with Hemlis. I've also been involved in lots of other weird(er) things, sure. But honestly, my reputation is quite based on the fact that I fight for the privacy and rights of people. I'm quite proud of me always following that. We've already been part of many lawsuits with Njalla, protecting our customers and fighting for them. Look at the typical demands we get (like https://njal.la/blog/about-those-threats/ ) and see how we react and take care of our users. We're WEIRD, yes, but that's the thing. We never want to be like everybody else. But fishy? Nah. We're actually vegetarians all of us, so call us veggie at least.

All it will take is one student that has basic tech knowledge and they will be a God among teenagers for showing their peers. *The nerds will run the world.*  Not all bad I suppose, will be a great motivator for young people to learn how to get around internet censorship.

10254	 shiki87	 I never paid for Porn. And this for nearly two decades.As long as the humans who want to see porn have more than 2 Braincells and know, how to use an Internetbrowser, they will find Porn. This move is not for Children. They don't even have Credit Cards or other ways to pay for Porn. This Law is to show to those, who don't know, how everything works, that they want to do something. It is targeted to those who send prayers and wishes and make a weird profilepic on their SM-site(Socialmedia-site).And many Pornwebsites are even outside of the UK. I don't know, if sites like Pornhub make enough money so they can't loose the revenue from the UK, but we will see, if those sites like pornhub, who show you free porn, will support this or not. But like you said, many parents don't want to know what shit their children are doing again so this is a nice way to be a bad parent again, not caring about those bastards, just give them their phones and they will mostly be silent and wont bother you.(i see exactly that so often these days...)	
10255	 Geminii27	 It's the name for the British Isles in the *1984* novel.	
10256	 dog_star_	 1) They want to track everyone and porn is a good excuse.   It is something that people won't fuss too much about because they either think it's immoral, want to appear to think it's immoral, or don't want to be the one standing up for privacy as the porn warrior.  2) They want to control the Internet and age controls are one way to do that.   It will allow them to block certain sites that aren't actually porn but do feature adult material.  It will cause many sites to self-censor.

You know that those are one of the weakest lock designs out there, right? And yet everyone still uses them. Do you know why? Because having a weak lock is better than broadcasting to the world that you're a sleeping baby ready to have his candy stolen. I take it you also never use encryption, since encryption can be broken by a lucky guess or a man in the middle? If it's not guaranteed to give you perfect security, what's the point, right?

10266	 OpinionKangaroo	 using a service like protonmail is the middle way between gmail (easy to use, apps for mobile) and using enigmail. right now with the low use of encryption i don't think you are in a bad position with a service as long as you can trust them. if encryption gets adopted more any a much higher percentage of people using pgp the switch to enigmail makes more sense since at least the emails you get without encryption are safe as long as the service is safe.you always have the problem with other people using encryption because most people can't be bothered even if the know gmail and the nsa read their mail...you take your account out of the easy scannable sector with  service like protonmail which means if they want to read all your mails they would have to find everybody you exchange emails with and have access to their emails.for me it looks like this:**1) using gmail with enigmail**a) emails to people with pgp are safe (but how many use pgp? 5%? less?)b) emails from any company you order stuff from, your holiday bookings, friends without pgp are still open for them to read (and they only need access to your emails for it!)**2) protonmail or any other service like them**a) your emails with pgp are safe (as long as the service is safe) (still about 5% :P)b) your emails to the rest are safe with the service but can be read if someone has access to ALL your contacts email providers. this might be more difficult for them since the providers might be from different countries with different laws.in a perfect world everybody would use encryprion and only you hold your private keys. until then protonmail etc. are a nice substitute as long as you trust them.

10268	 shiki87	 forbes uses malware in their ads too. Nearly all big websites use malware today. Use an Adblocker, and for better security, an scriptblocker and those pesky Ads and malware will be gone. If you are a decent Human, use adnauseam (adnauseam.io) and then the blocked ads will be clicked. And yeah, you maybe need to click a few times some buttons for new visited websites, but after a while you don't need to do that anymore. And maybe ask the websitemaintainer, why they need those scripts in their website. Some scripts are tracking you, look who you are, what you are and so on. Why give strangers your info on what porn do you watch or what medicin you bought?Your news are still valid, maybe another reason to use an ad/scriptblocker?(if you want to support an websitemaintainer, ask for paypal. even after all the fees, they get way more than with ads, if that will make your mind more peaceful...)

10289	 l27_0_0_1	 I would advice against using community forks of ff - just keeping up with recent CVE's and new types of security holes is a LOT of work and I don't trust them to keep up. More disturbingly, some devs use the old branches which probably have known and exploitable bugs. So the only solutions I see are brave and safari, I'm using latter.	
10290	 escalat0r	 This isn't true. One German authority was looking into some form of regulation of r/watchpeopledie. Reddit got wind of it and decided to establish a block themselves, which you can circumvent easily. That's it, one subreddit, one voluntary self-censorship *by reddit*, not legally requested.	
10291	 ChickenGoes2Library	 This is the method they chose to enact the block. It's obviously not the greatest way, but blocking the indexes/trackers is the only feasible solution they have. It certainly won't take a genius to circumvent, but these blocks have already been put in place by law, and, more importantly, they have worked. Any Torrent site which offers porn, but doesn't include age verification on it's site will be added to that list.OP implied that Porn would somehow find it's way to users because torrents... And that's not true because the UK government already blocks torrents, by the best means it can.

People downloaded it with .apk's or something that is shared among Gulen's followers. The victims like this girl, downloaded another app (also coded by Gulenist members) and tried that, which connected to famous "Bylock" servers somehow.Story is too complex to share, but the problem is an overwhelming majority of Turkish society has no idea about privacy and anonymity from what I read and hear.	
10317	 EUmpCDgZPYWJ9x2X	 &gt;If FF continues this pattern then one day it will be no different than Edge or Chrome.Sure, but we're not there yet. Cliqz was indeed a very stupid move and I hope they've learned from it. The sponsored ads thing is not worth throwing the whole browser out though. I'd say just disable it or remove pocket and you're fine. It's still a great browser. [Info on sponsored ads](https://help.getpocket.com/article/1142-firefox-new-tab-recommendations)However a nice privacy focused browser is the Tor browser. If you put it on high security settings you'll enjoy anonymous browsing that is fairly secure as well.	
10318	 gandonblyat	 I totally agree and in the first light of a good alternative browser, I'll change Firefox which I enjoyed using since the very beginning of it's kick-off. Love the community forks like waterfox but the thing prevents me to switch is the addons compatibility. 	
10319	 86rd9t7ofy8pguh	 u/strncat from r/CopperheadOS:&gt;CopperheadOS includes custom versions of all OS partitions, including recovery. If you're asking why the recovery it uses is secure (i.e. verifies signatures for updates, doesn't expose a shell - especially with root, doesn't expose wiping data partitions), then that question answers itself.&gt;It doesn't have a root implementation because it adds additional local attack surface and breaks the security model. The use cases that people bring up for root are really just features that they want properly implemented in the OS. The existing implementations of "security" and "privacy" features via root usually do far more harm than good. CopperheadOS doesn't do security theatre. Features actually have to work and be implemented robustly.([Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/CopperheadOS/comments/4zytkr/question_rootcustom_recovery/d70z61c/))

10323	 arkagno	 I'm in the same boat as you. Currently there are no other privacy focused browsers that perform as well as Quantum, and all Firefox forks are running on older versions.

10341	 Hello-Im-Random	 Thanks for the link. Interesting read, though it seems that the pace at which they ban sites is rather slow. It's still worrisome, but as far as I see all sites pointed out by https://proxybay.bz are not blocked.	
10342	 lolkep	 First up; this is not a thread about hemlis - but I'll reply anyhow. We used a danish bitcoin exchange (bips.me), that had all of their clients bitcoins stolen. No replies from them and I haven't heard more from the investigation that was being done with them. Also: people DONATED money. It wasn't a purchase or anything. It's not that we didn't have costs because, ultimately, the product didn't pan out as we hoped. We still spent the money - the money we had left over went for refunds to those who wanted that, and, as I said, we even gave refunds to some people after the money was gone. If you play on the lottery and don't win, it's not like you can get your money back because you didn't win. If you buy a car and use it for a few years, it's not like you get all your money back because you don't need it anymore. We worked for a year on the service, lots of people, most people didn't get any salary. We only paid external people as far as I remember.	
10343	 5footbanana	 This is just an entrance to block more stuff.    At the moment it's porn, which not many will stand up to defend.  What about when you're blocking sites which don't align to the government politically or a specific someone.	
10344	 RunePoul	 Sure, I don’t disagree with you, although terrorist is a technical term and in that sense you’re wrong. In any case I don’t think the porn filter is about porn.	
10345	 badwolf	 Also given that porn was a key cornerstone of reddit's early growth plan.	
10346	 flakysloth	 What block? There is no block on torrents in the UK. You can download any legitimate torrent you like. What is blocked are a handful of major websites that index copyright infringing torrents, that's all.You can torrent until the cows come home as long as it's legal content.	
10347	 XIncognito10	 Hmm that has some truth in it but it's usually a roundabout way of doing it. Why not try talking with them? Going on the mailing list saying a few words in Irc?. Unless you talk to them, they can't know what's going on. When they see one person leave for seemingly no reason, they won't do much. But if they have actual people giving their opinions on the state of Firefox then thats a wakeup call	
10348	 ChickenGoes2Library	 It's only slow because they didn't get their court case right...The English Premier League did however...

In regards to Hemlis, you mentioned on your blog that:&gt;We’ll release the usable parts of the code as free software with the most free license we can. It belongs to the community (and the community paid for it). The beta testers seems to like the UI/UX and so on, so hopefully that will be re-used in other projects.And never released any of it, any reasoning to that?	
10354	 ChickenGoes2Library	 The context of this thread isn't about legal torrenting. It's about torrenting to circumvent the law.UK government is forcing ISPs to block illegal torrents to the best of their ability, by getting them to block the index sites and also proxy sites too. Torrent sites offering porn will be blocked if they don't have age verification.OP suggested the UK government would shit a brick when they found out about torrents, when in reality, they were all over that years ago.

10358	 MaskedMillennial	 Abstract: Thanks to leaks we know how prevalent surveillance and spy tactics are inside the scope of technology. It's not just basement hackers or advertisers, its largely the government, the ones that are supposed to protect you. The CIA and NSA have made some the biggest 'improvements' to spyware and malware, which then often alerts everyone else to the newest revelation in surveillance. Giving militias, opposed states, and savvy teenagers the same tools as multibillion dollar organizations. It's no longer a secret that phones, computers, smart TVs, and even your car can be hacked. Now, with technology that accesses personal biometrics it should be no surprise that this private information is in the hands of those whom it was never intended. Yet, perhaps the most disturbing thing about the progression of surveillance is the public's welcoming attitude. Home listening devices like Amazon Echo and Google Home are selling like hot cakes. It's not enough to have similar technology like Siri or Cortana on your phone, it needs to be in your house too. In the public's loss of power they have confused the need to be heard with the desire to be listened to. We must remember even if we lock the door and close the blinds we are still not alone, unless you have set fire to your electronics and debugged your house, then you are probably alone. Probably.

10364	 KomputerIdiat	 The browser is Firefox and up to date. Youtube works fine, but pornhub asks me to install Flash or H.264 codec or something. The firefox came with this H.264 and it it enabled so...I don't know what's up. I do not want Flash.	
10365	 KomputerIdiat	 That is basically what I wanted. To surf the web via Linux, but game on Windows. Too bad the firefox still asks for H.264 codec when it already comes with it and it is enabled. Youtube works fine, Pornhub does not.	
10366	 KomputerIdiat	 &gt; You are more immune to malware, because there is much less Linux malware out there and it's much much more difficult to catch it on your PC.So...there is no protection at all but a reliance on a lack of Linux targeting malwares?   I will check those sites out. Thanks.

10371	 jtrillx	 Theoretically yes. Unless the gov then cracks down and blocks access to the onion project site. Though even then with ISP blocks in place they might just block all connections to anything tor related and then we're in serious levels of censorship and I'll be getting increasingly pissed off. 	
10372	 Antabaka	 I moderate r/Firefox. I'm talking about years of shit in the primary sub.	
10373	 tn47	 IMO there is no better option than a manually tweaked Firefox install for a privacy oriented browser. Alternatives are either potential security risks because they are maintained by too few people (e.g. Waterfox), or they are (in terms of respecting privacy) worse than FF (Brave with its built-in ad network, Vivaldi telemetry). I'd really like an alternative, but as long as I can opt-out or disable Mozillas "experiments" I'll use Firefox.

These two approaches are mutually exclusive, and result in some functions being present/absent in one browser but not the other, as well as different system requirements for either browser. Pale Moon also has a different set of goals as to what should be included in the browser and intended audience.  &gt;Pale Moon has a number of differences in the user interface and feature set to provide an as intuitive, predictable, logical and usable user interface as possible for the best user experience. Additional and removed features are, of course, specific to Pale Moon, meaning you may find some different way of working Pale Moon than what you are used to from other browsers, and some features or options not found in other browsers at all.  &gt;Note that Pale Moon will never adopt the Australis (Firefox 29 and later) interface and aims to remain a fully XUL-driven browser with full user interface customizability.&gt;Also please note that Pale Moon has not run rampant with its releases and even though there is a big gap in version number between the two, you should never assume Pale Moon is somehow an "outdated Firefox". Pale Moon is a completely separate product with its own roadmap, direction, versioning and release schedule, unlike all other "Firefox-based" browsers out there.

10393	 YXjs0t5Dcqq2E5Ev	 &gt; Appeal court judges have ruled the government’s mass digital surveillance regime unlawful in a case brought by the Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson.&gt; Liberty, the human rights campaign group which represented Watson in the case, said the ruling meant significant parts of theInvestigatory Powers Act 2016 – known as the snooper’s charter – are effectively unlawful and must be urgently changed.&gt; The government defended its use of communications data to fight serious and organised crime and said that the judgment related to out of date legislation. Minister Ben Wallace said that it would not affect the way law enforcement would tackle crime.&gt; The court of appeal ruling on Tuesday said the powers in the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 2014, which paved the way for the snooper’s charter legislation, did not restrict the accessing of confidential personal phone and web browsing records to investigations of serious crime, and allowed police and other public bodies to authorise their own access without adequate oversight.&gt; The three judges said Dripa was “inconsistent with EU law” because of this lack of safeguards, including the absence of “prior review by a court or independent administrative authority”.&gt; Responding to the ruling, Watson said: “This legislation was flawed from the start. It was rushed through parliament just before recess without proper parliamentary scrutiny.&gt; “The government must now bring forward changes to the Investigatory Powers Act to ensure that hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom are innocent victims or witnesses to crime, are protected by a system of independent approval for access to communications data. I’m proud to have played my part in safeguarding citizens’ fundamental rights.”&gt; Martha Spurrier, the director of Liberty, said: “Yet again a UK court has ruled the government’s extreme mass surveillance regime unlawful. This judgement tells ministers in crystal clear terms that they are breaching the public’s human rights.”&gt; She said no politician was above the law. “When will the government stop bartering with judges and start drawing up a surveillance law that upholds our democratic freedoms?”&gt; The Home Office announced a series of safeguards in November in anticipation of the ruling. They include removing the power of self-authorisation for senior police officers and requiring approval for requests for confidential communications data to be granted by the new investigatory powers commissioner. Watson and other campaigners said the safeguards were “half-baked” and did not go far enough.&gt; The judges, headed by Sir Geoffrey Vos, declined to rule on the Home Office claim that the more rigorous “Watson safeguards” were not necessary for the use of bulk communications data for wider national security purposes.The judges said the appeal court did not need to rule on this point because it had already been referred to the European court of justice in a case which is due to be heard in February.&gt; Watson launched his legal challenge in 2014 in partnership with David Davis, who withdrew when he entered the government as Brexit secretary in 2016. The European court of justice ruled in December 2016 that the “general and indiscriminate retention” of confidential personal communications data was unlawful without safeguards, including independent judicial authorisation.&gt; Security minister Ben Wallace responded to the ruling saying: “Communications data is used in the vast majority of serious and organised crime prosecutions and has been used in every major security service counter-terrorism investigation over the last decade. It is often the only way to identify paedophiles involved in online child abuse as it can be used to find where and when these horrendous crimes have taken place.”&gt; He said the judgment related to legislation which was no longer in force and did not change the way in which law enforcement agencies could detect and disrupt crimes.&gt; “We had already announced that we would be amending the Investigatory Powers Act to address the two areas in which the court of appeal has found against the previous data retention regime. We welcome the fact that the court of appeal ruling does not undermine the regime and we will continue to defend these vital powers, which Parliament agreed were necessary in 2016, in ongoing litigation,” he said.

10407	 asoka_maurya	 The future is quite bleak especially since a lot of plebians are quite willing to accept digital surveillance that compromise their privacy, brushing it off as unavoidable evil or tradeoff. They literally don't care whether its Google, Apple or their own country's three letter agency violating their privacy. In developing countries like India, its even worse as most don't even have enough digital literacy to understand what digital privacy is! And the government has already implemented an ID program that captures their biometrics, and insists on every service from banks to cell phones to cooking gas to link their customer's ID.	
10408	 ChickenGoes2Library	 You're ignoring the context of this thread. OP implied that torrenting could be used to circumvent the coming porn filter and that they government is going to have a shock when it happens.The reality is that the government is already blocking access to torrents, as best it can, by forcing the biggest residential ISPs to restrict access to the indexing websites...	
10409	 Finchlo	 Does this mean they are no longer allowed to view browser history with immediate effect or will it take a while to implement?	
10410	 TrashMacNugget	 Are you talking about [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7ty6hs/followed_advice_from_prismbreakorg_to_install/dtgbdvd/)?The way that Ubuntu (and most Linux distributions) works is that you have a "repository", and you install everything from there. Everything that goes in the repository has been approved by the Ubuntu Team. So even if that software is 3rd party, you're still getting it from an official repository.If you only get stuff from the official repositories, you should be good. (Make sure to disable the non-free repositories though.) Also, the program that guy recommended _does_ come pre-installed. I would recommend Synaptic instead though (`sudo apt-get install synaptic`). It's less user-friendly, but should work. (Note that you have to "mark" the things you want to do -- install this, delete that -- then press apply to actually _do_ them.)	
10411	 _fake_name_here_	 As described, torrenting will circumvent the porn filter. I imagine they'll use their new censorship powers to try and block torrent sites but they haven't mentioned any plans for that yet.

I’m proud to have played my part in safeguarding citizens’ fundamental rights.” Is there a wordplay on "access" here? Do they mean access in terms of access to data for the purpuse of retaining it? Or are we talking collect everything and attempt to restrict access? If its the latter, nothing has changed.It's as if they push the access issue beacuse it automatically grants the collecting.	
10413	 TrashMacNugget	 It might be blocked by port. See if it works if you use a different port.You might also try running a SOCKS proxy.	
10414	 ChickenGoes2Library	 That's because a lot of the smaller ISP are just piggy backing on the big 5's infrastructure. Basically the same thing just rebranded by the smaller ISP. For example Plusnet is just rebranded BT Infinity.

10426	 ChickenGoes2Library	 No, it will not. They've said that this block applies to all sites that do not comply with the rules. It's not just for porn sites.It also allows them to block sites en-masse and without court orders.Nearly every torrent site out there will be blocked. The block, in theory, also applies to the seeds/peers in the torrents. But I'd suspect implementing blocks might be a bit trickier for those.Saying that, the Premier League has a court order that allows them to block football streams at ISP level **in real time** so it's not beyond the realms of possibility.E: two words	
10427	 _fake_name_here_	 Well Plusnet is literally owned by BT. I'm on a smaller ISP piggybacking on a bigger one's infrastructure and I can tell you torrent sites aren't blocked. Blocking is done at the ISP level not an infrastructural one.

So, security patches of FF may take weeks to appear in WF and probably won't be checked and validated. And the greater the differences between WF and FF are, the more likely it'll be that new vulnerabilities show up in WF.

10448	 skidmark-steve	 I agree with this. Try Waterfox instead. Some people will tell you that this latest story about advertising functionality being built into Firefox is "nothing to be upset about". But that's how they get away with it; "slow and steady wins the race".Humans are generally more forgiving when someone apologizes and then *alters* their behavior. The silent add-on thing is still fresh in everyone's mind, or at least it should be. And I would argue that this "sponsored content" story proves that they really haven't corrected the course of things.	
10449	 FeatheryAsshole	 Ubuntu is better in every way, and IMO it's not that hard to get into if you know how to use any OS. Just make sure that1. You use Ubuntu LTS (the other versions have more bugs and only 9 months support)2. You don't pick the default desktop - it sucks in many ways. Try Kubuntu or Xubuntu, they are the same OS as Ubuntu, just with a different desktop preinstalled.	
10450	 PrivacyRabbit	 The statement, "If a service is not on the list, don't trust it" is misleading, with you leaving out a wide range of open-source, privacy in mind services. **On top of the fact that quite a few of your suggestions are closed-source and based inside the 14-eyes, which, as stated in the rules, are not easily verified.**Storage Recommendations: &gt; [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) - Open source (unlike SpiderOak), and option for self-hosting.Password Manager Recommendations:&gt; [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/) - Open source and a good option.	
10451	 86rd9t7ofy8pguh	 Interesting. I took some time digging into this. Is it why you removed bitcoin address from hemlis site back in the days? From wayback machine, it was [there](https://web.archive.org/web/20130806075930/https://heml.is/) only few months, i.e. the bitcoin address (then gone here in [November 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131122032027/https://heml.is/))? It was also addressed the same month from bips.me. Though, it seems that the address being used was [spent right way every time someone sends to it](https://blockchain.info/address/1HhXEHQHgi4yfgyRKYbPZBxHirYMfN5cuJ?show_adv=false)? Anyone interested can read about bips.me:https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-payment-processor-bips-attacked-1m-stolen/Also interesting timeline transactions from hemlis and the alleged DDoS attack. The hemlis bitcoin address was in use one year after the wallets being stolen (i.e. [from 2014-09-04 to 2014-12-21](https://blockchain.info/address/1HhXEHQHgi4yfgyRKYbPZBxHirYMfN5cuJ?show_adv=false))?Anyway, sad that you can't get your bitcoins back and also boring statement from bips.me by saying that [*according to the police they can not classify this as a theft due to the current non regulation of bitcoin*](https://web.archive.org/web/20131208110955/https://bips.me/press). Couple of months later in [2014 it was then acquired by Coinify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIPS). Weird.I hope that Njalla will stay safe.

10464	 skidmark-steve	 Continue using Windows 7, but learn Linux while the clock is ticking. If you are just an average user, it's not that hard. This is coming from a guy with an encrypted file system that spans 3 physical disks.You might prefer to install Linux on a spare hard drive, or on a spare PC. Or just throw yourself in the deep end by overwriting Windows with Linux (not recommended unless you have plenty of time to learn, (i.e. not a job).Also, Windows 8.1 might be an option for you. 8.1 will buy you another three years of Windows usage where you can actually switch all the reporting off (I think).

10470	 trai_dep	 Assume the worst and that some sleevy person is looking over your shoulder any time you're using their software roll-out.It'll be interesting to see what legal recourse you have. Check around with peers or teachers you trust, or any local privacy groups as well. Maybe send a message/contact Privacy International ([their site](https://privacyinternational.org) and u/PrivacyIntl here), as well. And post this in r/EuroPrivacy too.In the meantime, silo your GSuite sessions. Use a separate ID and browser and only use it to download or upload materials to a separate browser and Google Suite ID. Even better, to your desktop. Only use the school's ID to input/output finished product, not for editing or revising (to the extent possible).Google is very bad as far as privacy goes. Not as bad as Facebook, but still… Consider [reading our Peerless Privacy FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/wiki/index) and visiting [PrivacyTools.io](https://www.privacytools.io/) for better alternatives.Related question: why does your school know your Reddit handle, or any of your social media handles, for that matter? Even if you trust Vice-Principal Umbridge, do you trust her to be sophisticated enough to safeguard your online identities? Consider them tainted and switch to new ones. Probably keep the old ones after removing anything remotely controversial so school authorities won't be any wiser.You're in a weird spot since legally, students have fewer rights than adults. So you have to be craftier.Good luck!

However, in Hangouts' case, MicroG supports Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), which allows you to receive notifications in Hangouts.But using Hangouts with MicroG is just as secure (or lack thereof) as using it with regular Google Play Services. The difference is in the auth between you and the Google servers, where MicroG strips the personal bits off your data.TLDR: Yes, Hangouts works.

10496	 Icuw1pc	 Honestly Linux isn't even hard to use, I use Debian Stretch as my main distro. I love Debian for it's security and reliability. I've been running Stretch (stable) since it's release and haven't had a single issue. Most applications have a Linux alternative, or the application can be ran under wine. I run all of my application from Windows under wine without any issues, I even play some games under steam using wine since the steam support for Linux is kinda shitty itself. Plus you could always use VirtualBox or VMware to host a VM with W10 or whatever you want. You can allow them access to damn near everything it could need. Performance isn't bad IMO, here's my work/edc laptop:CPU: i7-3940XMRAM: 32GB DDR3 Corsair VengeanceGPU: AMD FirePro M4000Storage: 2 1TB Samsung 850 SSD's (one being mSATA) and a 2tb SeagateFireCuda for a storage/backup drive.Honestly does pretty damn good with gaming IMO.

If they plan on consolidating all of this sensitive information into a centralised database, it will be a huge honeypot for hackers (and corrupt governments, * **The Tory Party** *).If they go further and log peoples viewing habits then they have created a one-stop shop for blackmail.	
10499	 funk-it-all	 Yep	
10500	 86rd9t7ofy8pguh	 Concerning e-mail, [Posteo](https://posteo.de/en) should be the best one as it really stands out from [thatoneprivacysite.net](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/email-comparison-chart/).Also weird that you didn't mention TorBrowser.On OS, it should be Debian and not Linux Mint.Concerning *encryption*, I wouldn't recommend Cryptomator as the apps for Android and iOS aren't open source: ([check](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android/issues/36)). The best one should be [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html).Also the search engines you mentioned aren't in fact open source other than mere claims from them that they *respect* privacy or other fancy words associated with the word *privacy*. What about open source ones like [MetaGer](https://metager.de/en), [searX instances](https://github.com/asciimoo/searx/wiki/Searx-instances) and [YaCy](https://yacy.net/en/index.html)?Ultimately, when it comes to [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) (except for the *promising* one: YaCy as it's decentralized), we won't be able to know other than having to believe the claim that it's being advertised.&gt;According to Stallman:&gt;With SaaS, the users do not have a copy of the executable file: it is on the server, where the users can't see or touch it. Thus it is impossible for them to ascertain what it really does, and impossible to change it. SaaS inherently gives the server operator the power to change the software in use, or the users' data being operated on.([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service#Criticism))So, better search through Tor.On storage, yes local is best. The next one could also be [Least Authority](https://leastauthority.com/) or Nextcloud.Chat, you must be joking. What about [Ricochet](https://ricochet.im/), [Ring](https://ring.cx/), XMPP or at the very least Signal?Anyway, like what u/ourari said: *We don't all have to keep making these lists over and over*. Those kinds of lists are many in r/Privacy. Other than privacytools.io, there is also prism-break.org.Edit: wording	
10501	 ThunderousOath	 As far as I can tell it's all optional. They ask to collect data and make an account, but it's all usable without that. If you don't like that, use disconnect or whatever you find that's better. It works fine for me with ublock origin.

10510	 jarymut	 On Linux you are mostly using open source software that people actually tested in proper environment. On Windows, you have to trust that Microsoft tested *their* software. And on Linux side default system configuration is much safer. Just don't copy and paste commands you don't understand from internet and you will be much safer than on Windows :)BTW Windows, as a system, hasn't had any serious malware-related bugs for a long time, so **system** is safe. All issues are in other programs.

10515	 86rd9t7ofy8pguh	 Two-factor authentication vs two-step verification / authentication. Not the same thing. What you might be referring to is *something that was sent to them through an out-of-band mechanism*, e.g. the [mobile phone two-step authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication#Mobile_phone_two-step_authentication), which is not safe.Though, I would agree that if you use gmail and other PRISM partners alike that it will be easier to correlate that it is really *you* that is using their service *if* you use 2FA or have tied your 2SA with your phone number or is using [U2F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor). Unless you want to be "smart" with messaging the received code from 2SA to the intended person that wants to use a certain service. The same could be applied to 2FA as the master key for [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) can be copied.Edit: All in all, better to increase the security with 2FA or U2F when it comes to online credentials or even for example offline use like with your computer or other on-site local devices, say with [Nitrokey](https://www.nitrokey.com/) or e.g. with another promising one: [Nitrokey FIDO U2F](https://shop.nitrokey.com/shop/product/nitrokey-fido-u2f-20).

And Trump, who favors nuking Net Neutrality in favor of Comcast &amp; AT&amp;T's bloated profits. Screw everyone else, 'natch. But you'd think that *California* Republicans would heed the 85%+ general public support for Net Neutrality, assuming this support isn't even higher among CA residents.Dumb. Looks like the only solution is to remove as many who Republicans want to destroy Net Neutrality. Which in CA's case, means all of them!

10535	 strncat	 CopperheadOS uses verified boot so root wouldn't grant the ability to modify anything in the OS. It does have root accessible to `adb shell` in userdebug builds.It also does have the ability to disable the added Network permission group for an app, which includes disallowing it from using APIs like DownloadManager based on the INTERNET permission unlike simply blocking all connections with iptables.Using iptables doesn't really work because apps can access the internet via APIs exposed from other apps. If they have the INTERNET permission, they can use not just DownloadManager but other APIs exposed by the base OS or other apps with that permission requirement. Allowing access only to a specific IP via iptables doesn't stop them from accessing it via an API like that.There's a baseline iptables firewall but that's not how the Network permission group toggle works. It toggles whether the app processes are in the groups allowing socket access along with whether they pass INTERNET permission checks.	
10536	 [deleted]	 Just that it's hard to say if it will always be a viable option. The developer has his plans but they might not work out. Plus some might want to move back to ff once the web api's are finished.	
10537	 Throwaway_Apple125	 What a title...	
10538	 strncat	 Locking the bootloader enables verified boot on the supported CopperheadOS devices. It results in the entire OS being verified from the hardware root of trust. It's a very important security feature. If an attacker makes any modification to the OS after gaining root via exploitation, it will be detected by verified boot on the next boot (or earlier).On a Pixel 2, a public key is flashed when the device is unlocked which the devices stores in the Replay Protected Memory Block. The device is then locked, making the bootloader verify the vbmeta signature with the public key. It then verifies boot / dtbo / system / vendor with the hashes in vbmeta and the dm-verity hash trees for system / vendor. It also prevents an attacker from rolling back to an old version of the OS via rollback indexes in the RPMB.Nexus 5X/6P and 1st generation Pixels support full verified boot too, but not with rollback protection and it works a bit differently.	
10539	 theinspectorst	 Basically:- Tories voted for it; - Labour mostly voted for it - except Corbyn (and one or two other seniors) who, having whipped his MPs to vote with the Tories, then simply didn't show up for the vote himself - presumably so he could claim plausible deniability in front of his relatively liberal young voter base; and- the Lib Dems, SNP and Caroline Lucas voted against it.	
10540	 strncat	 Read the usage guide and technical overview. It has a toggle for the Network permission.It's not true that it lacks a firewall, but that isn't how denying network access to apps is approached because it wouldn't work due to apps being able to access the network via APIs exposed by the OS and other apps. The Network access toggle disables not only direct access to network sockets but also access to APIs requiring the INTERNET permission, which iptables rules wouldn't cover.	
10541	 LizMcIntyre	 Net Neutrality has everything to do with privacy and with freedom. If big cable companies have their way, they will have the power to throttle sites that don't support their world vision. That could be your VPN service that keeps them from knowing everything you do online.Don't believe me? Look to history.

10564	 SecuritySquirrel	 I am all about privacy, that is what I do for a living. However, once you give up the information it is VERY hard to get it back. So you gave them your name, address, phone # and e-mail address. Those are basic info that the average person can find in 20 minutes of searching. You gave them the information/copies of your Driver's License and/or Passport. OK, well they can't do anything with that information by law unless it is to verify you.You gave them your fingerprints and possibly your retinal scan. What would they do with that as a private organization? If it was for Global Entry, that gets put into a National Database that can be searched. CLEAR is a private company that wouldn't be able to just use it unless it was request by the Government for some reason.I am all for wanting to get your information back, but what are you concerned they will doing with it?Believe me, I wish there was a law saying that you can have that information purged and verify that it was upon written demand, but we don't live in that World.

10567	 nutpantz	 a firewall that uses app permissions is next to useless. sadly in android 90% of apps that have internet permission blocked will just refuse to run. a proper firewall blocks access while allowing the the app to run. vpn firewalls poor workarounds for a serious issue. it just highlights the need for a proper firewall.pretty much everything in android makes connections i dont want. from analytics to googles automatic error reporting to google dns providers to facebook or twitter for advertising just general advertising.

10573	 realmain	 You need to pass SafetyNet to use Android Pay, which means you'll probably have to use Magisk, which does root your phone.

10575	 realmain	 By text messaging, do you means SMS/MMS or internet based (like FB messenger, Skype, Discord)?If SMS/MMS, I personally use Silence, which is in F-Droid Store. And for internet-based, I use RIOT.

10577	 ForestOfCheem	 SMS/MMS.  Thanks.	
10578	 realmain	 Telegram is horrible to recommend here... The client isn't even 100% open source. DrKLO releases the source code on GitHub every like 6 months or so, but constantly releases new version on Play Store. Telegram-FOSS on F-Droid can't keep up-to-date because there is no source code to update to. Oh and DrKLO disabled the issue tracker too and ignores pull requests.	
10579	 realmain	 I suggest using Silence then. It also encrypts your local SMS/MMS.

10584	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
10585	 strncat	 I think you're missing the point of verified boot. It's primarily there to defend the device after exploitation. It raises the bar for physical tampering but that's not the primary purpose. It's a baseline AOSP feature available on Nexus / Pixel devices for any operating system willing to leverage it. CopperheadOS might be the only one doing that other than the stock OS, but it's there for anyone to use. Making proper fully signed production builds with the existing security features intact is the baseline, before the work in CopperheadOS come into play. The development involves adding further hardening on top of that baseline. Verified boot is standard.I'm also not sure how you can dismiss [all of the work on privacy and security features](https://copperhead.co/android/docs/technical_overview) as bringing nothing to the table. You might not use it but you do benefit from the changes landed upstream in AOSP from it either way.It does have a firewall and control over which apps can have network access which was already pointed out. Unlike directly using iptables, the Network toggle cuts off access to APIs requiring INTERNET access which would otherwise bypass attempted restrictions via iptables.	
10586	 realmain	 &gt; I don't understand this android disk encryption. I encrypted it (and I confirmed that it's fully encrypted via app) BUT when I connect it to my pc I can see the files just fine. When you first boot up your phone, you enter in your passcode and it decrypts your phone until you turn your phone off. If your phone remained encrypted when your phone is on, then you wouldn't be able to access your notifications, lib files (for apps), sms/mms, and none of your apps would work. You would have to decrypt your phone each time you turn it on then. I do not know if there is a program that encrypts your phone when you lock it each time.If you are worried about your phone being stolen, you can use Easer or Tasker to shut down your phone via an SMS command.	
10587	 86rd9t7ofy8pguh	 Not only are both Apple and Microsoft associated with PRISM or is partnering with the PRISM program, their OS' are closed source. When it comes to closed source, *by its nature you can not verify easily that it does what it claims and as a result this puts your privacy and security at risk*.

10591	 nutpantz	 No I don't install Facebook or Twitter or Google for that matter, but I've blocked the base AOSP os from connecting to Google, and many many other apps that connect to all manner of places that I don't think they should connect to. I can see every connection and can block it by ip address, by web address, or by application. With a firewall and host file....are you sure you know all the places your device tries to go?

10595	 seaninthecity	 Cool! I hope we can get some real input on whether using this in addition to a normal browser on iOS (I’m using Mozilla) could benefit us? We don’t get forced encryption options on iOS and some of the other features that this new browser contains, instead of getting grumpy - I’m just wondering if I should dual wield! Only because I need my Firefox bookmarks. I would consider using the duck duck go app for more sensitive things, but would really never do anything too sensitive on my mobile.

10598	 CorpMobbing	 The pomies have had mass surveillance for at least 10 years. My first trip to London. it was right before the Savoy got bombed. I was there a few months prior watching fiddler on the roof. &lt;- Save your money. Anyway, I was astonished by how many Fed cameras they had in the city. It didn't stop that shit.They even had it on the public buses and in the tube.That shit blew my mind. I'd never seen anything like it. At that time that was some high tech shit. 	
10599	 escalat0r	 &gt; it says "Unavailable For Legal Reasons This content is not available."Yep, that's what reddit put there, they're shifting the blame to the authorities but they didn't formerly request it. Read up on the news coverage and you'll find it.&gt;I think it is fine to keep that stuff away from children. And me. Well we can argue about that but it remains self-censorship by reddit. But sure, it's certainly not a nice subreddit.&gt;Requiring people to give up their personal info to watch porn is far far in the wrong.Agreed.	
10600	 nutpantz	 If it's a good vpn on a good device then everything is encrypted no matter what you are using. So all they see is the connection to your vpn. Nothing else.That will not take into account tracking that is already on your device like Firefox heath report, everything chromium, and everything else that phones home to report on you. But a good vpn protects you from outside monitoring what you are doing.	
10601	 jmw74	 Perhaps "had I been" would have been more clear :)	
10602	 trai_dep	 It should be interesting. The bill has quite a lot to offer.But the whole point of Pai's FCC is, "The FCC has **no** business – **none!!** – regulating the Internet." That is, the GOP-majority FCC argument through the many lawsuits and Congressional reviews, "The FCC has no jurisdiction."Well then. If it's not *their* jurisdiction, it falls to the states. States like California. NY. MA. Even TN.Hope that you made that bed nice and snug, Mr. Pai (and Ryan, McConnell &amp; Trump). Now go ahead and lie in it!	
10603	 jmw74	 No, but even you need to analyze the traffic to know what to block. The presence of a firewall doesn't save you that effort.If I found an app sending data somewhere I didn't want, that app would simply be removed. An app that secretly exfiltrates data shouldn't be trusted.Detecting the violation is more valuable to me than blocking it at the networking level.

10612	 integralvoid	 Net neutrality has nothing to do with privacy, except that it would grant unfettered access to a VPN service. However, ISPs can still inject ads, sell your traffic data, and more, even with net neutrality. Net Neutrality just prevents them from establishing paid prioritization or tiering.

10616	 Whiskey_and_Pine	 It's ironic that a place whose citizens have permitted the installation and operation of thousands and thousands of cctv cameras is suprised or concerned about surveillance getting out of hand.Edit: London is what I'm thinking of specifically, although I'm sure other cities too.

I find it useful to look through all of the pics on my computer, then delete the ones I don't need.**Options:*** Move pics on PC to another folder, which will make it delete off of your phone too due to sync.* Copy pics on PC to another folder, then whenever you plan to delete it off of your phone, it'll delete from the synced folder too.

10627	 ipev	 7, or 10; Microsoft is a company that has betrayed your trust. Even if you locked it down, you won't sleep soundly. Especially if you're updating it regularly. Microsoft is known to reset your privacy settings to defaults with some updates. Without updates, your OS is a walking target. With Linux, you won't be worried even if you didn't tweak your privacy settings. Many distros have stable updates and it won't break your stuff.

10634	 schmeowulf	 Depending on the games you play, you might not need to dualboot. Wine/playonlinux/CrossOver handles a lot of Directx 10 games just fine. Dx11 support is spotty but improving with most wine updates.  The *one* game I play these days doesn't work under any Linux setup I've tried so my laptop typically stays in Windows 7 and the desktop runs Void Linux.	
10635	 jewsonduh	 I did it, I’ll let you know. 	
10636	 nutpantz	 You will be finding very very few apps that don't connect to unnecessary locations, from error reporting hosted on Google to usage statistics for development to device information reporting for app development. I block outright over 170+ of 209 apps and the rest are restricted to locations I desire. And that is not counting the apps that just can't run so I uninstalled them.maybe 10 of that 209 don't try reporting elsewhere. (That includes the 89 basic system Rom applications) Without a fire wall I may as well have a flip phone with a green LCD call display. It's not perfect but it's the best I can get too right now.	
10637	 antaeusdk	 I wonder how that can be compliant with the EU GDPR...	
10638	 nutpantz	 That would depend on s number of things. What android version you want marshmallow? Oreo? Kit Kat? Are you willing to try and build it your self? Is there a custom recovery(twrp?) for your device? How much functionality are you willing to lose?(Google play store? Games? GPS? Camera? ) there are more roms out there than lineage but if it's not based on lineage many are crippled.	
10639	 seishuuu	 Then the browser has access to files, but there's no way a website could get that information unless you specifically upload an image.	
10640	 Arbor4	 Installing Firefox and UBlock Origin will give you quite a lot of privacy considering that it only has to be done once and you’re pretty much free from most trackers.	
10641	 nutpantz	 The os on a Mac is much like Linux (it's not Linux but based on freebsd or netbsd or something like that but don't quote me I have not looked at it in 10 years) so it's a little more secure vs virus attacks. It's a little more open to malware than Linux but much less than Windows. But fact is the company that created the os is in it for the money.Apple is a bit more privacy friendly than many others.but they have not built a product to protect your privacy.they built a product to sell to everyone they can. There are more security tools for Windows because they have the largest market share, hence the largest developer ecosystem.	
10642	 nutpantz	 "Silence" is good for sms (you must not care about meta data collection as it can't stop that(they know who's messaging who but not why)I would skip "signal" simply because they use your phone number to register you (So really it's not better than sms in my view)"Conversions" works with lots of options if you can get your friends set up on the same xxmp server (lots of free hosts)"Delta chat" is messaging over email servers with automatic encryption. (So you just need a email address nothing else)And then there are all the commercial ones but I have not tried them yet.	
10643	 [deleted]	 I feel like Apple doesn’t collect personal info because they make their money from hardware. Of course I could be wrong because they’re closed source. But I have a ton more trust in them than Google or Microsoft.	
10644	 ipev	 This is funny.They're dropping below Chrome's level	
10645	 nutpantz	 I have to say verified boot is useless on a open source product. If I really wanted access to your device I would build the Rom from source and tweak the verified boot to always report verified. Then install the Rom the same way you did or they did.  If you lose your phone, or have it taken away and then get it back it's no longer trustworthy. They're are just too many ways to falsify computer code. The reason the boot loader has verified boot on Google devices is not for your security it's for Google pay.  And that's been hacked to work regardless of the condition of the boot loader.	
10646	 nutpantz	 Google gives away what they put into android away for free. Apple makes money by putting customers into the apple ecosystem and never letting anyone made a dime without paying tribute. I have a hard time trusting anyone who controls everything by design. Is apple better than Google? No they are profit driven companies who would sell you down the river, if public opinion and the law required it. They do what sells devices first and everything else second.

10658	 percyhiggenbottom	 I've been on linux for 2 years now, Ubuntu and then lubuntu mainly due to old hardware issues but the increased security is also a plus. It's not really that hard or that big a leap from windows. I am not a programmer type.	
10659	 skidmark-steve	 The people who want absolute zero government involvement in the market, unless it is being done to prop up their business model/monopoly always make me laugh.

10661	 strncat	 &gt; I have to say verified boot is useless on a open source product.Verified boot doesn't rely on obscurity. ChromiumOS and the Android Open Source Project are both open source and it doesn't in any way make verified boot not work for them.&gt; If I really wanted access to your device I would build the Rom from source and tweak the verified boot to always report verified. Then install the Rom the same way you did or they did.That's not how it works. The bootloader starts the verification process via either the hard-wired OEM key or the configured custom key for the OS and displays the fingerprint for a custom key, which you can't reproduce without the signing keys. The bootloader is verified from the hardware root of trust.Regardless, as I already explained above, the main threat model for verified boot is an attacker compromising the OS with a remote exploit and privilege escalation not someone with physical access. It offers some anti-tampering protection as does the OEM unlocking toggle preventing unlocking without it being toggled on in the OS (which works for CopperheadOS) but the primary purpose is defending the OS after exploitation, not someone directly writing to the OS partitions with physical access.&gt; They're are just too many ways to falsify computer code. The reason the boot loader has verified boot on Google devices is not for your security it's for Google pay. And that's been hacked to work regardless of the condition of the boot loader.SafetyNet bypasses are not in any sense verified boot bypasses. On devices without key attestation, SafetyNet can't fetch the verified boot status in a reliable way. The verified boot status is reported in a reliable way to the user, not SafetyNet. Key attestation also isn't as reliable as the way it's reported to the user. You have it completely backwards...	
10662	 nutpantz	 I refuse to use chrome and Firefox may soon be abandoned by me. It's getting real hard to trust your web browser when they all share your location and have no off button	
10663	 [deleted]	 [deleted]	
10664	 nutpantz	 Btw I forgot to ask, how do you read the network logs without root? What do you use to see network traffic on your phone without root?	
10665	 strncat	 Apps can still make connections via APIs like DownloadManager with all access blocked via iptables. Blocking connections with iptables for an app also doesn't block them via those APIs since it's not the app itself making the connection.	
10666	 nutpantz	 We are two different people with two very different ways of securing our devices. I can't give up root and a proper firewall and hosts file in the minimum and you need what you need.	
10667	 strncat	 A proper firewall can't be bypassed by calling an OS or app API like DownloadManager. The CopperheadOS Network permission toggle blocks that, making iptables rules does not.DNS filtering works fine on CopperheadOS. Modifying the OS (/system/etc/hosts) to do it is unnecessary.	
10668	 tiiaj	 I don't think that you answered the question.	
10669	 DIYdata21	 I am new to androids in general, so I don't actually know what Oreo or Kit Kat are - I assume they are not biscuits or chocolates. :P I also am not skilled enough to build an OS myself, and I don't know if there is a custom recovery(twrp) on my phone. As for functionality - I don't care about the GPS or anything that needs GPS, or the games, but would like to keep the internet/google and the camera.

10671	 sevengali	 &gt;What difference would Tor and VPNs make if the porn sites and government know who you are?A VPN *in a different country* would help. As far as the Pornhub is concerned, I'm from Norway, and there's no need to force me to verify my age. If we assume it's a block done by the ISPs (similar to content filtering on mobile networks) that happens *before* you access the site, a VPN will get you around that. I believe that's more likely than forcing these non-British companies to make significant changes (forced login is something a lot of people would care about even outside this privacy bubble, *especially* with porn) just to cater to British rules.	
10672	 uph	 Bad advice. Op is better off using Signal.The use case for Silence is that you want to send encrypted messages, but you don't have a data plan or access to wifi so you want to do it over SMS. That's a security disaster and will only work between Android phones between two people who have the same unusual need. https://signal.org/blog/goodbye-encrypted-sms/ I'm guessing that's a very small number of people.&gt; I would skip "signal" simply because they use your phone number to register youWhy do you think that matters? Are you worried about Signal having your phone number? Or are you worried about your friends knowing your phone number? 	
10673	 uph	 See this comment https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/7u5tmj/what_is_a_good_text_messaging_app_with_respect_to/dtifzsc/Silence was create for a very specific use case. When used for that it's a security disaster, when not used for that there's no reason why you shouldn't use Signal instead.

10675	 loosedata	 MacOS is hugely better than Windows 10.	
10676	 Whiskey_and_Pine	 interesting, are those cameras or their footage linked to or legally required to be shared with the govt? Or are they solely under the control of their owners?	
10677	 throwawayacc1230	 Privately owned means that the government cannot requisition the footage without a court warrant, though an officer can ask if a crime has occured nearby and it's at your discretion to let him look at the footage.	
10678	 Whiskey_and_Pine	 Well I learned something today, thanks for enlightening me!	
10679	 PrivacyRabbit	 As already said, it will probably be easily bypassed by a VPN/Tor, it is highly unlikely porn sites will go out of their way to block said IP ranges, as it would effect users worldwide. The British government holds the fanciful idea that these sites will put in place such restrictions to cater to Britain only laws, it's highly unlikely.

10685	 FeatheryAsshole	 - packages in Debian stable regularly gets security updates; might seem like a duplication of effort, but this way you avoid regressions (which can be security-relevant, too), and Debian's security team is really on the ball.- packages in Ubuntu LTS aren't that much more recent; the newer versions you can download are for different Ubuntu versions that aren't as well-maintained with regards to bugs and security.- one 5 word password is reasonably strong, but would you rather have 20 different 5 word passwords, or one 5 word password that gives you access to 20 accounts with strong randomly generated passwords?- your local linux PC is a lot less likely to be hacked than an email provider's database or your email account.	
10686	 ScoopDat	 I don’t understand why this has any meaning. Who do the judiciary branch of government people think they are? At the swipe of a pen be able to shut down an operation of this magnitude?I really don’t understand any of this one bit. The people that find use for surveillance programs like these are far too powerful to give a flying rats motherfuck what any law says.. First off these intelligence agencies are far smarter, and have far more resources to covertly end anyone’s social or literal life that is currently in parliament if need be. So any individual law maker rising a hoot about not allowing the surveillance apparatus to keep functioning as is - becomes a victim in their crosshairs, sanctioned by the powerful politicians that do support the programs. Second, why would the agencies even comply with the law? What’s the worst that could happen? A director and few execs get sent to early cozy forced retirements with nice packages from their collaborators that supported them while they were on the job?I really struggle to grasp nonsense of this level, when you have the highest echelons of political circles saying they support these sorts of agencies, why would anyone care what the stupid courts deem.. the same courts that only have the power to prosecute those beneath them.. These courts know they don’t have the political backup on this matter, nor monetary backup..

10694	 postlapsar	 The problem is that smaller apps are more easily targeted. You need things like Orfox, Whatsapp, Telegram, and Signal. Also, dont put them on your phone. Use a second device with no cellular. Only connect to Wifi via VPN or Tor.	
10695	 86rd9t7ofy8pguh	 Privacy-wise both of them aren't comparable as they both are partners to PRISM program. None is better than the other.	
10696	 thereisnoprivacy	 Bring your own router. Unplug the the one at the house and plug your own in.If that's not sufficient, then get a router with SIM card support and use your own data/broadband plan instead of using the ISP at the house altogether.If that's still not sufficient, use a wired connection from the router you brought with you only, to prevent any WiFi snooping that might be going on in the background and use Tor. 	
10697	 akerro	 VPN in a hotel gives privacy not anonymity, they know who OP is, they gave them login and code to the WiFi.	
10698	 postlapsar	 False. The exit node only sees the connection to one site and it is probably encrypted anyway. The circuits are always changing for each site you visit and even if you operated a shit ton of exit nodes you couldnt meaningfully track Tor users.

10704	 DudeOnACouch2	 Some hotels still use a single username/ password for all guests.

10708	 frothface	 That's true. What I'm saying is they can see what sites you hit through DNS and any unencrypted traffic. But they only know who you are if you leak your identity, perhaps logging into JoeSmithsPrivateCloud.net or something like that.

10721	 RickeySanchez	 So the company in question is Ring, they make smart doorbells with cameras and a two way mic. They sell your data (excluding PII) but Nest, another company that makes smart home devices, does not. My main concern would be Ring selling information like how much time I spend at home, or other information that could be gleaned using the camera/mic. Mostly I want to know what workarounds companies have for selling data and what they can get away with selling as non Personally Identifiable information. And how does metadata have so much personal information? It was my understanding that metadata was just so a computer can know what kind of file it is and when it was created.

10725	 Kalrog	 I've seen some comments about your second point, but let me address the first point.  Yes, it is probably easier for a person to remember that 5 random word sentence than it is a crazy hard alpha-numeric password, but you are missing a bit part of the benefit of a password manager and one huge problem it solves.  The big benefit of a password manager is that it makes it trivial for each site you visit to have a completely different password.  That way if a hacker does manage to figure out your password (decrypting that sentence is probably no harder than decrypting a 25 character alpha-numeric-special-random password), they only get access to that site or resource instead of everything internet wide with your username.  Way too many people reuse the same password everywhere, which makes changing them difficult and means if you are compromised once you are compromised everywhere.  And if you have a different 5 word sentence for every resource, how are you going to remember them all?  Enter the password manager.  Some of them will even generate a multi-word sentence for you as your password instead of random characters.

If you're using a drive which uses encoding technology X, you only need to perform the passes specific to X, and you never need to perform all 35 passes.

This takes a little bit of work and preplanning but it works well.Set up a Linux computer at home.Install an SSH server by typing: apt-get install openssh-serverOpen up port 22 on your home router then direct it to your Linux computer.Install putty ssh client on your laptop.Configure a socks proxy in putty (there are lots of examples online) it takes two minutes.Configure chrome, or Firefox to use the proxy connection instead of internet.Test your browser by searching "what is my IP address" in Google.  You should see your home IP address and not the Airbnb's IP address.Of course this works where ever you are.

Did you see that Comcast has already tried to force consumers to use its VPN service and no others?The sad truth is that ISPs have been trying to take advantage of consumers for years, especially when it comes to their privacy. For example, Verizon has ignored voluntary “Do Not Track” standards. It also used to inject persistent headers into its customers’ browsers (essentially zombie cookies) that allowed third-party advertisers to track its customers, too. Verizon stopped the shenanigans after it was caught, but reportedly was open to resuming the practice.

Gralla criticizes how abstruse the telemetry info is to the average Joe and points out that Enterprise users can stop all data sending:&gt;Microsoft should change this. It should release a simple-to-use tool that shows in granular detail and in plain English exactly what diagnostic information is being sent to Microsoft. People should then be allowed to opt in or out for every type of diagnostic information that is sent. And everyone should be able to do that, not just those who have a specific version of Windows 10.

10800	 uph	 &gt; Not If you are using a phone number to identity someone.  Is this a response to "Don't you think recommending Silence over Signal misses the greater point and results in a net loss of privacy and security?"SMS/MMS also uses phone number as an identifier. So please explain how using Signal is less private or less secure than using SMS/MMS.&gt; Even just meta data creates an accurate picture of who you are and what you like. Yet you recommend using Silence which leaks metadata. Did you read the links I posted? Look again https://signal.org/blog/goodbye-encrypted-sms/"SMS and MMS are a security disaster. They leak all possible metadata 100% of the time to thousands of cellular carriers worldwide. It’s common to think of SMS/MMS as being “offline” or “peer to peer,” but the truth is that SMS/MMS messages are still processed by servers – the servers are just controlled by the telcos. We don’t want the state-run telcos in Saudi, Iran, Bahrain, Belarus, China, Egypt, Cuba, USA, etc… to have direct access to the metadata of TextSecure users in those countries or anywhere else."&gt; Now if your interested in security why on earth would you stamp that number on your private conversations? Your phone number isn't stamped on your private conversations. The only person who can see your phone number is Open Whisper Systems and whoever you gave your phone number to.

From employee numbers, to account numbers to wait in line numbers.. Why the push for everyone to give their phone number for everything?Again, look at the links I already posted. https://signal.org/blog/private-contact-discovery/"The building block of almost all social software is the social graph. For people to be able to use software like Signal, they have to know how to contact their friends and colleagues using Signal.This raises two related concerns:*    Building a social graph isn’t easy. Social networks have value proportional to their size, so participants aren’t motivated to join new social networks which aren’t already large. Very few people want to install a communication app, open the compose screen for the first time, and be met by an empty list of who they can communicate with.*    We don’t want the Signal service to have visibility into the social graph of Signal users. Signal is always aspiring to be as “zero knowledge” as possible, and having a durable record of every user’s friends and contacts on our servers would obviously not be privacy-preserving.Almost all social software has to deal with the first problem. Most solve it by leveraging an existing social graph, such as Facebook (“Sign in with Facebook”), but that means the social graph is “owned” by Facebook.Instead, Signal began by using the social graph that already lives on everyone’s phones: the address book. Rather than a centralized social graph owned by someone else, the address book is distributed and user-owned. Additionally, having the social graph already on the device means that the Signal service doesn’t need to store a copy of it. Any time someone installs or reinstalls Signal, their social graph is already available locally."&gt; easy is not a reason to keep doing a silly or bad thing.Did you solve the problem of private contact discovery?

10801	 EUmpCDgZPYWJ9x2X	 &gt;Ulbricht was first connected to "Dread Pirate Roberts" by Gary Alford, an IRS investigator working with the DEA on the Silk Road case, in mid-2013. The connection was made by linking the username "altoid", used during Silk Road's early days to announce the website, and a forum post in which Ulbricht, posting under the nickname "altoid", asked for programming help and gave his email address, which contained his full name. * [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Ulbricht#Silk_Road,_arrest_and_trial)So not really a weakness in Tor, which you seem to be alluding to. If you make such claims, it's best to come with specifics and even better cite your sources. What vault 7 leaks specifically, how would those attacks work, etc.	
10802	 postlapsar	 I think you are talking about a different level of opsec than the OP. Sure  if you are running something like silk rd, all bets are off. But for 99.999% of internet users Tor will preserve your privacy.	
10803	 lutrick	 Since I don't believe there is a native multi-platform solution for password protected zip files you're going to need some type of 3rd Party Software. If you're going to use a 3rd Party Software anyway it is worth looking at other options.You're better off using an Encrypted Container or a good password manager.VeraCrypt can create encrypted file containers.VeraCrypt also has the advantage of being 3rd Party and Multi-Platform.If you're on a single platform there are more options.You can create an Encrypted container using FileVault (Mac Only), Bitlocker (Windows Only), or I believe LUKS (on Linux). Microsoft Office 2013 or newer (don't use 2010/2011 or older) also has reasonable levels of encryption, if you're looking for ease of use, however won't offer the same level of security as an encrypted container.KeePass is also an old standby and regarded as fairly secure. It is also available on multiple platforms, although they're 'unofficial' ports and have not been audited. Still KeePass X* or XC, KeePassDroid are considered the go to for other platform support.People will likely say some of these options are bad because they're not FLOSS/FOSS but it really depends on who you're worrying about keeping out.*KeePass X hasn't seen an update in a while, but is still pretty widely used. EDIT for clarification: When using something like an Encrypted Office File or Zip File you put all your files into a folder and encrypt it with a password. When you want to use them you put the password in and it unpacks your files to a location (such as %TEMP% on Windows). Theoretically when you're done, these files should delete. However this is not always the case. The advantage of a File Container is that the computer treats it like an external storage medium (flash drive, hard drive, etc). So you should not have the issue of unencrypted versions of your files being on unencrypted parts of the computer. Now bare in mind that the encrypted file container is still accessible by software on your computer when its unlocked, so still a good idea to do it on a computer you trust.	
10804	 postlapsar	 It is best not to do banking and other sensitive things on public wifi, but if you must, a good VPN is the best bet. For general browsing, use Tor.

If you're just worried about people snooping in on a poorly secured network, or feel uncomfortable looking at private stuff on some else's internet, a VPN will hide your activity. In this case the any activity on the internet would all appear to be to the VPN. They would know where it's originating from, ie you, but not what it is because everything looks like the VPN.In the situation you described nothing more really is needed. If your friend or the AirBnB owner get curious and check the traffic on their router, it won't show anything about what you're doing. I'd imagine neither person would be trying hard to monitor all your activity anyway. Keep in mind of course that other privacy concerns still apply. Google can still see what you do on Google, and the VPN provider may be able to see what you do on it. But those are general concerns for all situations.	
10806	 Aspro_kapelo	 I don't travel that often and have never seen it but alot of the Sys's I work with and other people from [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/4ipi0a/hotels_blocking_vpn/) have been seeing it lately. It isn't that hard to port block and would stop a lot of people because I would say the majority of people using a VPN have minimal knowledge on how they can bypass someone trying to restrict access to them.

10808	 furquan_ahmad	 Aadhar (as the ID program is called) is a lot worse than what's going on elsewhere. All information is recorded and connected to every thing from bank accounts to welfare schemes to subscriptions. Not only there's no concern on security by the government, the data is accessible by private companies. For example I found [this image](https://i.imgur.com/pQpo1DC.png) on some startup's site (which claims to offer "digital protection" to your Aadhar data) which pretty much sums up how bad the situation is. It's a privacy nightmare and since there are no concrete laws in India on digital privacy, all of this (and more) is completely legal.	
10809	 merger3	 Yes and no. Mostly no. Using Gmail on iOS doesn't mean Google now has access to everything on your phone. It only has access to what the operating system gives it, which I believe you can restrict in settings. But it doesn't suddenly mean Google has root access to your phone and everything on it. Apple has an incentive not to let Gmail and Google run wild on their devices.However, you better believe Google is tracking everything they have access to, including of course your emails. If you have to use Gmail then restrict the apps permissions if possible and only use it for strictly business related things. Use a different email for personal stuff.Preferably don't use Gmail at all of course, but I know that this isn't always an option. Just try not to use more than necessary. Just using Gmail is still way better than using all Google stuff on Android.

10817	 merger3	 Android with a custom ROM and no Google services is the best option for privacy. Stock Android is the worst, and I doubt a custom ROM with Google services installed is much better. iOS is somewhere between them. Apple doesn't track as aggressively as Google and gives you somewhat more control over it, but they do still track you.As for security, iOS has been the gold standard for a while. Stock Android is also very good for it. Custom ROMs require more technical knowledge to secure especially with root access so that's something to remember. Copperhead is a custom ROM that's supposed to be optimized for security but I don't know a lot about it.If you have the technical knowledge or want to learn go for the custom ROM. If you don't want to take the risk then go for iOS. Stay away from stock Android.

10827	 skidmark-steve	 GWX is the Get Windows 10 app. It rode in, with a meaningless name of "update for Windows KB3035583" and a description disguised to "resolve issues in Windows". This is the thing that would pester you every day about converting to Windows 10, without giving you a "no, and stop asking me" button.Microsoft made sure that if you combed through the installed Windows updates you wouldn't find it, unless you explicitly knew what to look for (since they disguised it).http://noel.prodigitalsoftware.com/ForumPosts/Win81/KB3035583InImportantUpdates.pngAs if that weren't bad enough, even if you found this out and manually uninstalled KB3035583 while opting to not be offered the update anymore in Windows Update, Microsoft disregarded the setting and installed it over and over again anyway.https://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/you-need-to-stop-kb-3035583-from-installing-again/Microsoft also promised customers that Windows 8.1 would get mainstream support until 2018, but that didn't stop them from pulling the rug out from under users early by blocking them from Windows Update if they upgraded to Ryzen/Kaby Lake processors, which came out in the beginning of 2017.https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/04/19/chap_fixes_microsofts_windows_7_and_8_update_block_on_new_cpus/TLDR: Nobody ever got market share by being honest!Finally, in order to get the users who were steadfastly clicking the red X for the better part of the year, Microsoft automatically scheduled them for a Windows 10 installation. Next time the hapless user clicked the red X, they were actually "consenting to the install". https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DChm2CpWr0U"We know these users weren't interested, but the free offer was about to expire, so we just foisted it onto them regardless!

10846	 MaximumCrumpet	 The implementation seems to be to require that commercial porn websites challenge users to provide their age.  The consequence for not doing this is:* A fine of £250,000,* Requiring payment processors suspend transactions for the company,* Require ISP's to block access to the website in question.Those things are a kiss-of-death to any commercial operation, so large operators will probably comply.  It's more interesting with user-generated websites.  Is Reddit a commercial porn operation?  What about blogging platforms?  Image sharing websites?  Social media?  Content aggregators?  None of this seems to be clear.This will likely prevent *very* young people *accidentally* stumbling upon porn while everyone else uses an unblocking proxy, VPN or Tor.  It wouldn't surprise me if the next stage is to target things like proxies, Tor and VPN's by arguing their business model is to provide a tool to circumvent UK ~~censorship~~ law.

10853	 trai_dep	 Microsoft's horribly designed front end for "giving back privacy to Windows users" strikes me as a [Dark Pattern](https://darkpatterns.org). A user interface designed to push users away from making the best choice for them and instead choose the options that the (evil, usually) company wants them to make.The thing is, Microsoft hires armies of U/I designers. Or there's always their usual option, copying whatever it is that Apple did a couple years ago. The presentation and controls for Redmond's latest are so user hostile it seems planned.By the way, Dark Patterns is a great site to visit, with plenty of examples.

10857	 TankorSmash	 &gt;  Other software gives you that option why can't an operating system?

10860	 nutpantz	 First off yes sms and mms are horrible. Regardless of how much you encrypt anything it's got this big number attached to it that identifies you. They can use this big number too see who you talk to and how often. This big number is called a phone number.And it any communication based on your phone number should be considered easy to trace to you and every one you talk to. The phone companies promise not to let anyone listen in on your conversations UNLESS told to by law. Pretty much the same thing "signal" promises. So what's the difference?Second-secure communicating is not a social graph. It's not about how easy it is to remember what your Id Is. It's not about your social standing and how many people you know.It's about making it as hard as possible for ANYONE for ANY REASON to know what you are saying and to whom.  And using your phone number is about as smart as using a fitness tracking app to keep in shape while you walk the perimeter of your super secret relaxin getaway from it all and porn cabin. 	
10861	 Y783ZO22MDBQ9S2	 As long as you are using a tun/tap adapter with the correct priority all traffic will go through the VPN. Double check with trace-route utility before and after connecting.Also research kill switch scripts, depending on your provider they should offer you one without having to write your own. That way nothing leaks outside the tunnel.

10873	 KJ6BWB	 I honestly have no idea.  A quick Google search seemed to suggest that states may require plates to be mounted "in such a manner as to be visible when approaching from the rear" and that there may be a minimum "height above the road" requirement.  I would postulate that, given the wide variation in bumpers and license plate location in various frames, the cameras probably look for a plate, and don't really care where on the vehicle it is?Oh, wait, another Google search found http://www.city-data.com/forum/new-jersey/1470533-legal-put-your-front-license-plate.html&gt; Your license plate must be "horizontal" and installed so that it sits no less than 12" and no more than 48" from the groundNot official, but they could be right.  I guess it might depend on your state?In Idaho it wouldn't be a problem: https://legislature.idaho.gov/statutesrules/idstat/title49/t49ch4/sect49-428/ -- no max height, just at least 12 inches from the ground.

10876	 Exaskryz	 In general it would be learning Pyħon, but it is so clunky. Powerful, but clunky, since you have to go out of your way to download every little component that would be useful instead of it all being bundled for you.Everything I'm seeing in that list is like 10% of AHK's functionality, and if I downloaded all of the options for Linux, togeħer they might cover 30% of AHK's functionality.Edit: Actually, AutoKey, digging through its documentation, might cover 25% of what AHK does on its own. It's definitely feature incomplete wiħ being able to create a file, but not delete or modify it apparently. I don't see where you can load the file to variable yet, but I suppose you could do that, make your modifications to the variable, and then output the variable to a new file to work around modifying it -- still leaves the desire to delete the original. I'm also not seeing any image manipulation -- looks like that's where Sikuli comes in; but how compatible they are is unknown to me -- and I'm not even really seeing string manipulation like using Regular Expressions	
10877	 postlapsar	 It is like buying a computer from a big box store. Most people never change the default settings unless someone does it for them. Getting people to switch to Linux is mostly a losing battle, but we can help our family and friends by changing some defaults and installing a couple of browser extensions. As long as it requires little or no effort on their part.	
10878	 JeffersonsSpirit	 One of the biggest benefits to a password manager like Keepass is that it gets your passwords OUT of the browser. The browser is the most vulnerable piece of software on a desktop system, and once the browser is hacked, they can get all your passwords/accounts. There was even a tracking practice revealed not long ago where websites were putting invisible login prompts so that those with autofill enabled could have account names tracked. Having a master password in Firefox is better than nothing, but once its unlocked (logging into reddit for example), a firefox that has been exploited can cough up ALL your account/password information stored in the browser.Contrast this with keepass. My browser is logged into reddit. Lets assume Firefox is exploited by another website I'm viewing- they now could get my Reddit account information... but all of my other accounts are secure in keepass. Keepass will only input account/password information when you use the keybind you set (ctrl+shift+p for instance). I went further and have keepass automatically lock the database after 5 minutes of inactivity (inactivity of keepass). So even if my browser is exploited and then my OS is compromised they can only get my encrypted keepass database (where if it was unlocked exploiting my OS would give them everything). And I only need to remember 1 password- everytime I go to login to a site, the unlock database prompt pops up when I hit my keybind, I input that 1 password, and then my login/password goes in. Simple and secure.The responses on software package versions are accurate, so I don't need to go too in depth here. You need to pick your poison: either you deal with rock solid stability and older package versions (Debian Stable, Ubuntu LTS, etc), or you get all the latest packages but deal with occasional breakage (rolling release i.e. Arch, Debian Sid, Fedora Rawhide, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, etc). You have to make the choice of what works for you. I would personally use a Stable distro first to get comfortable with Linux, and then switch to a rolling release distro if the "bleeding edge" is what you're after. Debian Stable is awesome here because depending on what you're after, you can often use the "Backports" repository to get newer packages while retaining the stability only Debian Stable can provide.

10885	 thereisnoprivacy	 &gt;  If you encrypt the data in the camera it is going to drain the battery faster, slow the processor, the write speeds... Considering that encryption can be optional, not mandatory, and therefore a non-issue for those who (think that they) don't need it, this is not at all a valid rationalization.	
10886	 GrinninGremlin	 There are *degrees* of privacy caring.  Yes, someone who wanted an impenetrable information fortress that would have the NSA so frustrated that their agents would be committing mass suicide...probably not a Windows user.  But an "average joe" that is primarily interested in just minimizing the spying...might use Windows with a few limitations on what data they input.	
10887	 nutpantz	 Briar looks good from what I read on their web page.  I will definitively watch them and their development. I don't like that they did not ask to turn on my bluetooth (that issue is already being addressed) but I'll post that in issues if they are on github.it's in beta so all accounts expire right now. But I like what I see so far. As long as they don't start charging a subscription fee or ask for phone numbers they might be my next go to when they get out of beta.	
10888	 andrewornot	 You can use Gmail with Apple's email app instead of downloading Google's app. Go to **Settings &gt; Accounts &amp; Passwords &gt; Add Account**. Google will still be harvesting your emails for advertising purposes though.

10890	 kefi247	 Ah this is Great, an article about how big companies intrude upon our privacy, on a website which makes 441 requests, many of those to external domains including these:* facebook.net* twitter.com* google-analytics.com* scorecardresearch.com* googletagservices.com* adservice.google.com* google.se* doubleclick.net* quantserve.com* cloudfront.net* ads.pubmatic.com* googlesyndication.com* walmart.com* match.adsrvr.org/track* krxd.net	
10891	 KidneyPoker	 Since the logs will be readily available for people capable of reading them our known privacy advocates will I’m sure like always let us know if anything is amiss. And while it would be nice to have the data ready to go in a easy to read format that has security and privacy risks. Being easy to read means anyone sifting through your web traffic may be able to steal possibly sensitive data in a ready to go package for whatever use they may find for it. Web traffic is something any newb with pen testing setup can easily mess with. Understanding how coded logs apply to a system is a whole other bag of tricks.

10893	 kefi247	 Here’s a full text copy of the article:# Google and Facebook are watching our every move online. It's time to make them stop	* 	Google and Facebook's impact on our privacy cannot be understated.	* 	76 percent of websites now contain hidden Google trackers, and 24 percent have hidden Facebook trackers, according to one study.To make any real progress in advancing data privacy this year, we have to start doing something about  [Google](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GOOGL)  and  [Facebook](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=FB) . Not doing so would be like trying to lose weight without changing your diet. Simply ineffective.The impact these two companies have on our privacy cannot be understated. You may know that hidden trackers lurk on most websites you visit, soaking up your personal information.What you may not realize, though, is  [76 percent of websites](https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/)  now contain hidden Google trackers, and 24 percent have hidden Facebook trackers, according to the  [Princeton Web Transparency &amp; Accountability Project](https://webtap.princeton.edu/) . The next highest is  [Twitter](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TWTR)  with 12 percent. It is likely that Google or Facebook are watching you on many sites you visit, in addition to tracking you when using their products.As a result, these two companies have amassed huge data profiles on each person, which can include your interests, purchases, search, browsing and location history, and much more. They then make your sensitive data profile available for invasive targeted advertising that can follow you around the Internet.This advertising system is designed to enable hyper-targeting, which has many unintended consequences, such as the ability for bad actors to use the system to influence the most susceptible or to exclude groups in a way that facilitates discrimination.Because of their entrenched positions in a wide array of Internet services, each collecting personal information that together combine into these massive digital profiles, Google and Facebook can offer hyper-targeting much better than the competition.As a result, they now  [make up 63 percent of all digital advertising](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Google-Facebook-Tighten-Grip-on-US-Digital-Ad-Market/1016494) , and accounted for 74 percent of this market's growth in 2017, according to eMarketer. Together they form a tight digital advertising duopoly, showing no signs of abating.Google and Facebook also use your data as input for increasingly sophisticated AI algorithms that put you in a filter bubble — an alternate digital universe that controls what you see in their products, based on what their algorithms *think* you are most likely to click on.These echo chambers distort people's reality, creating a myriad of unintended consequences such as increasing societal polarization. On their unending march to profit from more and more personal information, Google and Facebook have shown little regard for all the negative consequences of their runaway algorithms.So how do we move forward from here?Don't be fooled by claims of self-regulation, as any useful long-term reforms of Google and Facebook's data privacy practices fundamentally oppose their core business models: hyper-targeted advertising based on more and more intrusive personal surveillance. Change must come from the outside.Unfortunately, we've seen relatively little from Washington. Congress and federal agencies need to take a fresh look at what can be done to curb these data monopolies. They first need to demand more algorithmic and privacy policy transparency, so people can truly understand the extent of how their personal information is being collected, processed and used by these companies. Only then can informed consent be possible.They also need to legislate that people own their own data, enabling real opt-outs. Finally, they need to restrict how data can be combined including being more aggressive at blocking acquisitions that further consolidate data power, which will pave the way for more competition in digital advertising.Until we see such meaningful changes, consumers should vote with their feet. DuckDuckGo found that about a  [quarter of American adults](https://spreadprivacy.com/mainstream/)  are already taking significant actions to take back their privacy. Helping in this effort are seamless browser add-ons that will block Google and Facebook's hidden trackers across the Internet, as well as more private alternatives to their core services. I can say from my own experience, you can indeed live Google and Facebook free.If we do nothing about Google and Facebook, we will get more of the same: more hyper-targeting, more algorithmic bias, less competition and the further erosion of collateral industries, like media. Enough is enough.The complete loss of personal privacy in the Internet age is not inevitable. Through thoughtful regulation and increased consumer choice, we can choose a brighter path. I hope to look back at 2018 as a turning point in data privacy, where we awoke to the unacceptable implications of two companies controlling so much of our digital future.*Commentary by Gabriel Weinberg, CEO and founder of  [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/), which makes online privacy tools, including an alternative search engine to Google.

10894	 share_me_plz	 Pretty much nothing besides Orfox unfortunately. Guardian lists their projects here: https://guardianproject.info/apps/You can use a VPN, not as anonymous, but far better than nothing.	
10895	 snakko	 &gt; Enterprise users can stop all data sendingNot completely, I used LTSB 2016 for a few months (Enterprise branch), and it still has a "basic" telemetry setting, you can't turn it completely off even on that (unless you use some third party tools, risking to break stuffs).Edit: these are the settings from a LTSB 2016 virtual machine I keep around (just because it's the "cleanest" Win10 version you can get, without all the store and UWP shit) just to test stuffs occasionally:https://i.imgur.com/2WA6PuT.pngedit2: the fuckers had a page about telemetry levels and stuffs for enterprises, but they apparently removed it for no reasons.https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/configure-windows-telemetry-in-your-organizationedit3: now it seems online, yesterday it gave me 404 not foundfrom Google cache:https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:9nX0IbMqpqsJ:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/configure-windows-telemetry-in-your-organization+&amp;cd=13&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=it&gt;Security. Information that’s required to help keep Windows, Windows Server, and System Center secure, including data about the Connected User Experience and Telemetry component settings, the Malicious Software Removal Tool, and Windows Defender. So there's still a bit of "phone home" you can't turn off.	
10896	 LizMcIntyre	 The best fix is for Microsoft to stop forcing telemetry. Period.	
10897	 LizMcIntyre	 It sounds like a problem begging to be fixed. AKA an opportunity for someone.	
10898	 DuskSnare	 Both Enterprise and Education edition have the option for sending minimal data to Microsoft (Telemetry in Group policy editor with option set to Security), but not completely disabling telemetry in newer updates. 	
10899	 shawnshine	 None that I can see, but I’m also keen to try out alternative messaging apps and services. 	
10900	 scenariolobby	 Can you tell me why is office a bad idea?	
10901	 randomgamerguy1997	 are there any good privacy email services that allow for IMAP access I can get for free? preferably a service that has no politics	
10902	 randomgamerguy1997	 Honestly, LibreOffice isn't even a real replacement for MS Office.

10904	 LifeLikeAndPoseable	 So definitely China gov style. 	
10905	 prebijak	 AutoKey offers just some convenience functions since you can already do a lot easily with pure Python:* [Writing and reading files](https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/inputoutput.html#reading-and-writing-files)* [Deleting files](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/os.html#os.remove)* [Regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/re.html#module-contents)Not sure what you mean by image manipulation, there are many Python libraries for image manipulation (for example, [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/3.0.0/index.html)). AutoKey can [click on image pattern](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/blob/master/new_features.rst#id2).	
10906	 asdfpotatoasdf	 veracrypt encrypts disks or containers. The files which are placed in it are encrypted while they are within the encrypted container. When it is brought outside of the container, it will not be encrypted. If you want file encryption, veracrypt is not the right tool. You will want to use encfs or gpg.To your first question: You can see that the file is encrypted (in the sense that  you can't view it when the volume is dismounted) by trying to view the file when it is not moutned. You will notice that there is no way aside from your password which you need to provide. Make sure you have a long password and have good random entropy when creating the cryptographic keys	
10907	 UGoBoom	 I'm wondering this too. Protonmail seems to claim IMAP is insecure, but I fail to understand why IMAP w/ SSL is insecure when FTPS and HTTPS are considered secure?	
10908	 Bluebugjuice2	 I removed bluetooth but it’s still being recognized. It must be the way I dual booted?

10915	 GearBent	 Linux has it's own issues too that need to be sorted out, namely Gnome and SystemdJust avoid Gnome and Systemd and everything will be fine; go for a distro that uses runit and KDE.	
10916	 GearBent	 Why do you think Windows 10 doesn't allow you to disable updates?Microsoft doesn't want you to be able to say no.	
10917	 Exaskryz	 If only I had any formal computer programming learning.And my understanding is Windows has a lot better API than Linux does; especially because Linux has a wide variety of distros that you can't expect each version to support the features of your automation.	
10918	 Exaskryz	 &gt;AutoKey can click on image pattern.Yeah, that's the problem I'm seeing with any Linux option. You need to install another dozen oħer programs or libraries.

10925	 Youknowimtheman	 A chip with AES-NI enabled is not going to suffer significant performance or battery life penalties. You're talking an extra watt.	
10926	 Kok_Nikol	 Cool site! Thanks!	
10927	 prebijak	 Indeed, UNIX systems have always preferred composition of simple programs over complex solutions. Though in this case, Python is pretty much “batteries included” for all common programming tasks and the remaining ones could be probably done with less than a handful of libraries.	
10928	 1n5aN1aC	 Yup.  Not only that, but if you 'hid' the update, implying you didn't want to install it, they have re-published the update about 8 times so far, each time causing it to show up again as a regular, unassuming update.	
10929	 theen	 Shrug. Isn't pleb accurate? The common person really doesn't care.	
10930	 vteead	 What was the point of his medium post.  I think he wanted other students of the professor to comment, or communicate to him that they remembered the professors conduct.  As he said that he at times was not clear about it happening.The later anecdotes about his seeking summer employment with the    RCMP was not relevant to this, nor what he described the RCMP employment facilitator telling him.  This does not seem relevant to r/privacy.
